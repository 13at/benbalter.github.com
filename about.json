Before that he was a Fellow in the Office of the US Chief Information Officer within the Executive Office of the President where he was instrumental in drafting the President&#8217;s Digital Strategy, on the SoftWare Automation and Technology (SWAT) Team, the White House’s first and only agile development team, and as a <a href='http://reboot.fcc.gov/blog/?authorId=593709'>New Media Fellow</a>, in the Federal Communications Commission’s Office of the Managing Director where he played a central role in shaping the agency&#8217;s reimagined web presense. His paper, <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/'>Towards a More Agile Government</a> was published in the Public Contract Law Journal, arguing that Federal IT Procurement should be more amenable to modern, agile development methods.</p>\n\n<p>An aspiring attorney, a coder, and an all around geek, Ben’s triple-threat skill set bridges three distinct disciplines: a formal <a href='http://ben.balter.com/category/law/'>legal</a> education and commitment to advocating on behalf of others, a deep-seeded understanding of the intricacies of today’s <a href='http://ben.balter.com/category/business/'>business</a> decisions, and a life-long passion for <a href='http://ben.balter.com/category/technology/'>technology</a>‘s ability to shape how we interact with one another. When not working or in class, he enjoys tackling otherwise-impossible challenges to sharing information using nothing more than duct tape and occasionally a pack of bubblegum.</p>\n\n<p>After graduation in May, Ben hopes to find an avenue to explore his dual passion for law and technology in the nation’s capital.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to e-mail me at <a href='mailto:ben@balter.com'>Ben@Balter.com</a> or you can find me on these social networks:</p>\n<ul id='contact-links'>\n  <li><a href='http://twitter.com/BenBalter' rel='me' target='_blank'><img alt='Twitter Icon' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/twitter.png' /><br />\n  Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a href='http://facebook.com/BenBalter' rel='me' target='_blank'><img alt='Facebook Icon' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/facebook.png' /><br />\n  Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a href='http://linkedin.com/in/BenBalter' rel='me' target='_blank'><img alt='LinkedIn Icon' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/linkedin.png' /><br />\n  LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a href='https://plus.google.com/107848665104278257250?rel=author' rel='me' target='_blank'><img alt='Google' src='http://cdn.benbalter.com/images/32px/google.png' /><br />\n  Google</a></li>\n</ul>"}
