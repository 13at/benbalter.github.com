Hey there government CIOs. I've noticed you've been getting a bit of a bad rap recently. And I have to say, with all the stories of [multi-million dollar websites](http://www.dobt.co/What-Is-The-Future-Of-Open-Government/) going around, I'm not sure that I can fault your critics. But don't get down on yourself, at least not yet. You're still in great shape. You've got ample resources; you've got smart, well-intentioned people working for you; and you've got more low-hanging fruit than most private-sector CIOs can even dream of.

It's a matter of taste. It's a matter of style. It's a matter of doing things right from day one. And it's really not that hard. It's actually a matter of doing less, not more. You just need to think smaller, not bigger. But you're not in it alone. We're here to help. Just follow this simple Style Guide for building new systems going forward:

## Lean

If there's a less heavyweight solution, and you're not using it, you've over-engineered things. Look to existing tools (think open source), services (think APIs), and practices (think shared standards). Simpler applications are easier to scale, easier to maintain, and have fewer components that can break down. Prefer [JSON](http://jsonapi.org/) to [XML](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/xml-the-angle-bracket-tax.html), [REST](https://github.com/whitehouse/api-standards#pragmatic-rest) to [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP), and [static](http://jekyllrb.com) to [dynamic](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/01/welcome-to-the-post-cms-world/). Fear complexity.

## Iterative 

If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, youâ€™ve launched [too late](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-iterate-fast-and-release-often-philosophy-of-entrepreneurship-2009-11#ixzz2U7lGAS2A). It doesn't need to be perfect or complete. Publicly ship 0.1, not 1.0. Start small and ramp up to where you want things to be. Watch how customers receive things and adapt accordingly. Be transparent, manage expectations. Let your vision evolve.

## Decentralized

Avoid single points of failure, both in systems and in people. Push decisions to the edge. Trust the crowd. Don't bake it [locks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science). Avoid blockers. Eliminate all humans. 

## Open

Barriers to the free-flow of information just add friction and more often than not, you just end up shooting yourself in the foot. Make open the default. Open standards, open formats, open systems. Expose process.
