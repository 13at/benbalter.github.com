As the newest kid on the block, it&#39;s one of the few government agencies to have been born in a digital era, and more importantly, without the bureaucratic baggage that all too often stymies innovation. They have a chance to &quot;do it right&quot; from the start… and they&#39;re doing just that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An Agency Born of the Internet Generation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, CFPB <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/\">announced a bureau-wide preference for open source</a> in its shiny new <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/\">Source Code Policy</a>, by my <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=source+code+policy+site%3A.gov\">crude research</a>, a first for any government agency. There are two watershed shifts here: first, that the agency not only should, but <em>must</em> evaluate open source software on equal footing to its proprietary counterparts, a comparison which I believe will <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth-Networks-Production-ebook/dp/B0015GWX0S\">increasingly fall in open source&#39;s favor</a>, and second, that unless there&#39;s an overriding security or similar concern <em>not to</em>, public code must be public. There&#39;s nothing new here. All it says is that we should use the best software for the job (a no-brainier), and that that software, the public&#39;s property, should belong to the public.</p>\n\n<p>So why is this news? Plenty of government entities have <a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/blog/contributing-code-back-fcc-govs-open-source-feedback-loop\">released</a> <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/02/11/whitehousegov-releases-second-set-open-source-code\">source</a> <a href=\"http://open.nasa.gov\">code</a>, or <a href=\"https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit\">encouraged the</a><a href=\"http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/infrastructure/docs/AGuidetoOpenSourceSoftware.pdf\"> use of open</a>-<a href=\"http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/p03_opensource_paper_english.pdf\">source software</a>. But no one has come out and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/victorzapanta/status/189390759181557760\">plainly stated that they were an &quot;open-source agency&quot;</a>, that open source is the new default, and that absent an affirmative step by some nay-sayer, that the public will have access to their code.That&#39;s huge. It&#39;s flipping the burden, and it&#39;s the way things should be from the start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But Where&#39;s the Beef?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That said, there&#39;s one thing the source code policy is noticeably silent on: <em>the ecosystem</em>. Posting code is great and it&#39;s great that they&#39;ve done the legal legwork so other agencies can follow suit, but that&#39;s just the 1.0. The true power of open source comes not from simply publishing code, but from being a member of a broader coding community. Can a CFPB employee contribute a patch to an existing open source project on CFPB time? [^1] What about contributing to a CFPB project once he or she&#39;s left? What happens to my rights when I fork a <a href=\"http://github.com/cfpb\">CFPB project on GitHub</a> and send the agency a pull request? [^2] Can the agency even accept my code legally? [^3] There&#39;s a lot of legal ambiguity there, and it&#39;s just the kind of legal ambiguity a well-intentioned government attorney can seize upon to gum up the very gears that are driving this incredible move.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve seen the same progression in the open data world. The 1.0 is posting 10 XML files at a gigabyte each — an arms-length relationship with developers — arguably open data simply for open data&#39;s sake. The secret sauce lies in the relationship, in publishing APIs and web services rather than static data, to build an ecosystem around the agency&#39;s work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An Innovation Ecosystem</strong></p>\n\n<p>Imagine if government agencies served as the catalyst for a <a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/2012/03/05/wordpress-for-government-and-enterprise/#p%5BNssBlW%5D\">joint public-private effort to drive tomorrow&#39;s innovation</a>. We saw this during the space race, and see it today in terms of government-funded research, but by-and-large, open-source coders have yet to be included. Sure we&#39;ve seen the &quot;let&#39;s have some open-source developers build this for us for free&quot; type challenges, but that&#39;s about it. There&#39;s no ecosystem, no community, no push-pull or give-and-take, and I&#39;m worried that as CFPB&#39;s efforts federate across government, this nuance may not federate along with it.</p>\n\n<p>The agency&#39;s already got <a href=\"https://github.com/cfpb/transit_subsidy/pull/1\">it&#39;s first public-generated code contribution</a>, and can expect at least one more on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/2343578\">their gist of the policy</a> (Ed. note: does CFPB not <em>own</em> a Blue Book?!), but the possibility of such a relationship with the citizenry doesn&#39;t seem contemplated by the policy, let alone included as integrally as it should.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to see the next iteration of the policy have a third section, &quot;III. Membership in the Open-Source Community&quot; on not just publishing code they&#39;ve developed in house — don&#39;t get me wrong, that&#39;s huge — but actually *contributing *meaningful code to the broader ecosystem, and working directly with the open-source community to foster an active partnership that delivers the best citizen services possible. It&#39;s a dialog, not a code dump. There needs to be a conversation there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Procure, Publish, Participate.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the realization that when you use open-source software, you&#39;re not a customer. You&#39;re a member of a community. You&#39;re invited to a pot-luck dinner. There&#39;s not the same sense of entitlement you have with proprietary software. It&#39;s not that they owe you a given feature. There&#39;s no financial transaction there. It&#39;s that that feature hasn&#39;t been developed yet, but can be, the same way every other feature has evolved, through community contributions. There&#39;s an entirely different philosophy driving the relationship.</p>\n\n<p>For open source in government to work, it&#39;s got to move beyond procuring community contributed open-source projects on the one hand, and releasing open-source code developed in house distinctly on the other. It&#39;s about feeling a sense of belonging. It&#39;s about the agency taking on a sense of ownership in the broader project. It&#39;s about participation. [^4]</p>\n\n<p>I think CFPB gets it in a big way, and the fact that this is memorialized in writing is a major step in the right direction. They&#39;ve got the basic mechanics down — procure open–source projects, publish open-source code — but the missing secret sauce that would really drive the policy home? Participate in the open-source community as a matter of policy.</p>\n\n<p>+1 CFPB, +1. <em>Welcome to the community.</em></p>\n\n<p>[^1]: In simple terms, the core of open-source projects (as distinct from community-contributed plugins or modules) are primarily fueled by &quot;patches&quot; (small code change sets) in response to bugs or feature requests, that get committed to the project&#39;s codebase and released in subsequent versions. \n[^2]: If the project is licensed as government work, are my code contributions now government work? Are the government employee lines of code under a broader license, while mine are under a more restrictive license like GPL or apache? \n[^3]: Is this considered a donation for Federal ethics purposes thus requiring disclosure? \n[^4]: This can manifest itself in lots of different ways, but most tangibly: going to local meetups and conferences (or hosting them); contributing to the project&#39;s core by introducing new features, documentation, or posting to support forums; abstracting business logic from the start to be more broadly applicable to other developers; outreach and evangelism; and fostering relationships with key stakeholders within the community</p>\n","path":"_posts/2012-04-10-whats-missing-from-cfpbs-awesome-new-source-code-policy.md"}
