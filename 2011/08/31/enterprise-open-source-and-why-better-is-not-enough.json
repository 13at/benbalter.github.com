[^3]</p>\n\n<p>What is it about technological progress that sends many running for their digital security blankets? [^4] For some reason, much of the resistance appears to be <a href=\"http://opensource.sys-con.com/node/692407\">uniformed doubt</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, &quot;It&#39;s different&quot;), rather than <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/gartner-seven-cloud-computing-security-risks-853\">calculated avoidance</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, &quot;It&#39;s less secure because you can&#39;t prevent X&quot;). To be fair, the business world, and even more so CIO&#39;s, see avoiding uncertainty and minimizing risk as a core competency, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the whole story.</p>\n\n<p>The rapid pace of innovation has rendered many stakeholders and decision makers out of the loop when it comes to where a given technology stands in relation to their current practices, and for good reason: disruptive technology poses a risk not only on a organization level, but on a personal level as well.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>From a practical standpoint</strong>, all other things remaining constant, a firm&#39;s move to the cloud, for example, <a href=\"http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/news/1381193/IT-job-security-fears-over-cloud-computing-Network-jobs-still-vital\">brings into question the security of the sysadmin</a> that has spent years building up a fiefdom of server farms.</li>\n<li>  <strong>From a skills standpoint</strong>, there&#39;s a whole generation out there that grew up on the Internet, and many of those in a position to make purchasing decisions or recommendation are simply not part of it. A young upstart consultant coming in and showing up the veteran can potentially be a recurring (and realistic) <a href=\"http://www.lexjansen.com/pharmasug/2000/techtech/tt16.pdf\">nightmare for many baby boomers</a>.</li>\n<li>  <strong>From a professional standpoint</strong>, at its most basic level, risk is taken by individuals (who propose a new system, procedure, etc.), which in many organizations may have an incentive to adopt a &quot;don&#39;t rock the boat&quot; mentality for their own career&#39;s sake, rather than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax\">risk being wrong</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If technological innovation were simply a matter of calculated risk and switching costs, one would expect firms to be <em>equally</em> as unlikely to upgrade an existing technology as they would be to switch to a new one. Mathematically, upgrading in-house servers to the next version of Microsoft Exchange may<a href=\"http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/messaging_value.html\"> far outweigh</a> a move to the cloud. Yet, large firms have been <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/07/paving-road-to-apps-adoption-in-large.html\">slow to make the change</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a whole world out there of distributed, open innovation that, with the exception of a few startups, [^5] has been widely ignored by IT departments, and as Yochai Benkler argues in <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Networks-Production-Transforms-Markets/dp/0300110561\">The Wealth of Networks</a>,</em> if history suggests anything, it is that the proprietary model is on its way to the endangered species list.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s the answer? How can open source fanatics and other early adopters rescue the change averse from their self-perpetuated anachronisms?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Talk about <em>solutions</em> not technology</strong> – Geeks love shiny new things. It&#39;s in our DNA. Yet rarely are geeks the one making the decisions. Decision makers could often care less which acronym powers something, but rather than dumb things down (&quot;this thingy talks to that thingy&quot;), translate the situation in terms of <a href=\"http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_82.htm\">organizational change</a> (&quot;it will wholly eliminate the need for paper forms&quot;). Rarely does technology change without the organization following suit. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Solution-Selling-Creating-Difficult-Markets/dp/0786303158\">Approach the situation as a human problem</a>, not a technical one.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Move past &quot;<em>If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it</em>&quot;</strong> – &quot;<em>It&#39;s good enough</em>&quot; should never be a persuasive argument for stagnation. Just because something has been used in the past, does not mean that it should. [^6] </em>In software development, changes fit into one of two categories: bugs and enhancements. Saying that something &quot;works&quot; ignores exactly half of the equation.</li>\n<li>  *<em>Broadcast excellence *</em>- If you ask me why an organization should use SharePoint, I have at my fingertips <a href=\"http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/benefits/Pages/default.aspx\">focus-group tested ammunition</a>. Ask my why you should use WordPress, and I&#39;m <a href=\"https://encrypted.google.com/webhp?oei=4HNeTqaVEsb50gGCldE7#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Why+Wordpress%3F+site%3Awordpress.org&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=Why+Wordpress%3F+site:wordpress.org&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=3748l3748l0l4002l1l1l0l0l0l0l128l128l0.1l1l0&amp;qscrl=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=4bf87fb63526ad5b&amp;biw=1123&amp;bih=733\">left to pretty much fend for myself</a>.  Curators of innovative technology need to make themselves known, and give those empowered to affect change, the tools to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The future&#39;s coming. That&#39;s for sure. Change is inevitable. Firms looking to seek a competitive advantage will begin to look past &quot;<em>it has to be expensive and complicated</em>&quot; and start looking toward open-source software, not as a misfit alternative, but as a viable player in the software space, but before that can happen the open-source community must step it up, and strive to be the serious competitor they wish to be treated as.</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Update (9/1): *</em>Not quite &quot;focus-group tested ammunition,&quot; but in a sort of meta-dogfooding, I took a stab at articulating &quot;<a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/2011/09/01/why-wordpress/\">Why WordPress</a>.&quot; Edits welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n\n<p>[^1]: Penenberg, Adam L.
