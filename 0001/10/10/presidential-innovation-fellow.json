Many personal Web sites used lackluster TinyMCE formatting (bold, italic, bullets, nothing else) or simply stuffed pre-styled HTML into an existing page. I can't even begin to fathom the workflows some people must go through every time they want to update their resume.[^1] A few purpose-built plugins offered a slightly more streamlined approach, but cluttered the backend with unnecessary and unfamiliar menus, and spawned legions of database tables to store the data.\n\n*Enter WP Resume…*\n\nWP Resume is an out-of-the-box solution to get your resume online and keep it updated. Built on WordPress 3.0's custom post type functionality, it offers a uniquely familiar approach to publishing. If you've got a WordPress site, you already know how to use WP Resume.\n\n**Features include:**\n\n*   Support for sections (e.g., education, experience), organizations (e.g., somewhere state university, Cogs, Inc.), positions (e.g., bachelor of arts, chief widget specialist), and details (e.g., grew bottom line by 15%, president of the sustainability club)\n*   Follows best practices in resume layout and design\n*   One click install, just start adding content\n*   Drag and drop ordering of resume elements\n*   Built on existing WordPress code, utilizing a single custom post type and two custom taxonomies\n*   The WYSIWYG editing experience you know and love\n*   Revisioning\n*   Integrates with your theme like they were made for each other\n*   Custom URL\n*   Does not use pretentious accents on the word \"resume\"\n*   Extremely original title\n\n![][2]The hardest part of getting your resume online should be doing the work listed on it, not wrestling the publishing platform.
