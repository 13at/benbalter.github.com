One of the most reliable tools in a Product Managers' toolbox is qualitative and quantitative user research. Looking at real-world product usage, running experiments, conducting interviews, and seeking feedback through formal and informal channels are invaluable sources of insight and inspiration.

Shortly after joining GitHub, I was introduced to the concept of the [Cluetrain manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/) (named for the fact that for many marketers, the clue train stopped there every day, but they never took delivery). In short, it says that "Markets are conversations". Companies can shout as loudly as they'd like about how great their product is, but customers will always have a louder, more trustworthy voice.

Rather than creating artificial walls between those who build a product and those who use it, companies (and their employees) should participate in the communities that naturally form around them, and seek to facilitate natural, open, honest dialog among humans, and there's no better person to serve that role than Product Managers. Instead of press releases that sound like they are created by robot committee, think Twitter replies, Hacker News comments, or replying directly to support requests. As a Product Manager, your job is to be part of that conversation, and most importantly to be human.
