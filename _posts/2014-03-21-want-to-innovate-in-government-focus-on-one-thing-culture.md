I've said before, when innovating in government, [the technology's the easy part](http://ben.balter.com/2013/07/01/technologys-the-easy-part/). Innovative efforts in government do two things: they take long-established [technology from the private sector](http://ben.balter.com/2013/09/30/ten-things-you-learn-as-a-presidential-innovation-fellow/#innovative-efforts-in-government-are-standard-practice-in-the-startup-world) and inject it into an agency, or they reimagine long-assumed processes [from the citizen's perspective](https://twitter.com/BenBalter/status/444941012016713728).

If you want to innovate government, 90 day, 120 day, or six month "fellowships" (read: glorified internships) aren't the way to do it. Talk to any Code For America or Presidential Innovation Fellow and you'll hear a reoccurring theme. Absent sufficient cultural support, between 30 and 60 perecent of your time will be spent not doing what you were hired to do, but convincing others that you should be doing it.

You have to fight for the tools, you have to fight for the workflows, you have to fight for the resources, and you have to fight for the solution itself. Every step is a fight, and that's assuming you don't have to argue things that are assumed in the rest of the world like the security of PHP and Ruby or the need for continuos deployment. And that's just the technological considerations.

Bureaucracy is an organism. Its primary goal is survival. Like any organism, it has an immune system. The red blood cells of bureaucracy are general counsels, privacy officers, security officers, and paperwork reducers, among other bureaucrats. It's in their interest to reduce risk to as close to zero as possible. They thrive in a culture of "no".

An innovator's primary goal is sustainable disruption. These two countervailing interests — administrative and business — balance each other out in most organizations, however, government gives the immune system the privileged position of veto authority over any agency decision.

You could have the most innovative idea, perfectly executed and fully within the letter of the law, but if any one of the ten to fifteen layers of agency's immune system so much as sniffs an antibody they don't like, the effort's dead in the water — bureaucratic allergies.

So how do you solve for the naysayer majority? culture. Culture isn't a weekly getting a coworker a card for her birthday, or a office-wide March Madness tournament. Culture is the unspoken assumptions that start any assumption. Culture defines the realm of the possible.

What if when you first approached your general counsel for approval for your innovative new idea, you didn't have to explain open source software, APIs, or distributed version control, but could say "hey, we're launching a Rails app with a read-only API. The code's going to be on GitHub", and they simply said "okay". What if those you relied on understood not necessarily the how, but at least the why?

"Parashooing" change agents into an organization is great, but if you really want to inject innovation in government, look to the support roles. They're the "blockers" in the true software sense of the world. They're the ones in need of innovation.

What if every Wednesday the General Services Administration invited an innovator, a CEO or CIO of a private sector company, to come inspire government employees, both technical and otherwise, to hear how they work. We're not talking about a sales pitch, we're talking a super informal, Inside the Actor's Studio style "ask me anything". How do you handle hiring? Customer service? How do you decide which ideas to run with?

The idea is to expose otherwise isolated career government employees, not to cutting-edge ideas, but to commonplace practices well established in the private sector.

If you want to foster innovation, when an innovator approaches a non-technical stakeholder, there needs to be a common vocabulary, the type of vocabular that you expect between coworkers as a San Francisco startup. Heck, even GitHub's accountant [knows enough code to be conversant](#).
