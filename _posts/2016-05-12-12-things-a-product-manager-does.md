title: Twelve things a product manager does

When I first considering trying to become a Product Manager, I read [a lot](https://medium.com/@joshelman/a-product-managers-job-63c09a43d0ec#.t7puifka7) [of posts](https://medium.com/@matbalez/product-manager-you-are-664d83ee702e#.6054jkko8) [about what](https://medium.com/@bfgmartin/what-is-a-product-manager-ce0efdcf114c#.nfocpyput) [a product](https://medium.com/@irishbryan/product-managers-are-apes-21f25828dcb7#.ujgo9swh6) [manager does](https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/50-articles-and-books-that-will-make-you-a-great-product-manager-aad5babee2f7#.1t1kwhhly). Many of these posts, books, and resources were helpful to understanding what role a product manager plays within an organization, or what common things great product managers due, but given the diversity of the term within the industry, it was hard to get a sense of what a product manager's typical day looked like, if there was such a thing.

I've been keeping notes on everything I've done as a product manager over the past few months, and bucketizing things a bit (as product managers say), here's my list of the twelve most important things a product manager does:

### Team captain

Depending on how your organization is structured, there's a good chance that teams — the internal groupings that do the organization's day-to-day work — and products — the user-facing things you actually exist to build — don't align. A product might be built by an engineering team, tested by a QA team, documented by a docs team, and supported by a support team, among many, many more. You're the captain of the cross-functional team that ties all those desperate efforts together. Part quarterback, part social worker, part organizational sherpa, and part match maker, your job is to do whatever it takes to ensure players do their best on and off the field.

### Research and strategic thinking

It's easy enough to take the top feature off the queue, grind away for a few weeks, ship, wash, and repeat. Leave that to your team. Your job is to spend at least one day a week (yep, that's 20% of your time), taking a step back from the day-to-day and focusing on the month-to-month and the year-to-year. To think through the tough non-technical problems you're product's trying to solve. Who's your target audience? How many people actually use that feature? How are they using it? Can you remove it? Can you fold two features into one? What does the user experience look like in a month? A year? Three? Five? You need to be the one that knows the product best, today, and five years from now.

### Communicate and coordinate

Your team should focus on shipping. You should focus on all the meta-work necessary to create the space that allows that to happen. That means memorializing synchronous meetings, shuttling information to other affected teams, and coordinating cross-team efforts (and overcoming any organizational politics that may arise). At GitHub we have the idea of [servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). As a product manager, your job is to provide your team with the political, yak-shaving, and unblocking air cover they need to focus on shipping. Make sure other teams know what you're doing, are able to opt in to additional context, and harmonize any supporting or parallel efforts across the organization.

### Solve for what customer wants, not what asking for

Customers are experts at using your product. They're not necessarily experts at building it. It's all too easy to [optimize for the squeakiest wheels](http://ben.balter.com/2016/03/08/optimizing-for-power-users-and-edge-cases/), but those year hear from most are not necessarily your target customers. As a product manager, your job is to solve for the target customer's problem, not to respond to a-la-carte feature requests. For one, you have the privilege of a birds-eye view. You don't just see one use case, but all of them. For another, you enjoy the benefit of data, both historical and experimental. Most importantly, you should have a vision for what the product can, and should be doing, even if it's not doing that today. Your customer wants [a 1/4" hole](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/). They may ask for a bigger drill bit or a stronger motor, but the right solution might ultimately be an adhesive hook.

### Prioritize and sequence

At some point you'll realize there's always going to be more to do than time to do it, and that that's okay. Given a solid product, there's going to be no shortage of ideas, both internal and external. Add to that, the fact that given the right talent, any technical challenge is surmountable, and you'll find yourself presented with near infinite possibilities. Your job as a product manager is to prioritize those tasks, floating highly-visible bugs and those features that target your core use case to the top of the list on the one hand, but also to sequence tasks, to knock out the low-effort, high-impact features first, and then schedule the rest in an order that makes sense on the other. If you've ever played a real-time strategy game, you know how important it is to properly sequence early investments along side resources. Product management is no different.

### Capture every idea in an issue backlog,

### Keep up with industry tends and customer demand

You're responsible for keeping the lights on, for keeping the servers up, the trains running on time, and the (existing) customers happy. But that's the showing-up-to-work-on-time of product management. If [the Innovator's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma) teaches us anything, it's that your job isn't to ship the product that customers want today, but to constantly be preparing to ship the product that your customers will want six months, a year, or even a few years from now. That means trudging through all the Slack bot announcements on Hacker News, Product Hunt, and TechCrunch to be able to plot the industry's trajectory, but also being your organizations's foremost expert on your users and their needs. You should seek to cultivate an encyclopedic knowledge of everything that affects your product, inside the organization and out.

### Explain Why, not what

Don't confuse urgent with important
Don't confuse measurable with important
PM's aren't allow to have excuses
