Looking for *the next big thing*? Chances are it's already here, and chances are the open source community is using it. If you wanted to know the next trend in medicine, it makes sense to look at how doctors take care of themselves. The same is true for geeks. It's about looking to the early adopters.

Countless technologies we take for granted today, began their lives as staples of the open-source development workflow. Command line based text editors like [VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) — essential to the creation of the first open souce projects — quickly gave rise to more evolved word processors like WordPerfect and Microsoft Word. Centralized [version control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control), an open-source necessity eventually found itself in the hands of consumers in the form of DropBox, and if the @reply and #hashtag vernacular of Twitter looks familar, that's because it first emerged, nearly identically, as developers first collaborated on [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).

Each of these technologies, although they got their start in open source, found the market in radically different, often simplified form.
