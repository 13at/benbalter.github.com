Every job has its up and downs. As a manager (or a coworker) one small thing you can do is to brighten up the otherwise-meh days, even if all you know is the information on a standard HR form. Here's three easy ways to show that you appreciate the humans you work with:

### Birthdays

Most humans have birthdays. Some humans don't care much for candles, singing, or mass attention, but  many humans would at least appreciate a quick "*Happy Birthday! I hope you have something fun planned this weekend.*" DM or email.

This is especially true if you're remote. While onsite culture provides not-so-subtle queues like flower deliveries and stumble-upon opportunities like cake in the break room or communal drinks after work, when you're remote, you don't have such luxuries and it's even more important that you go out of your way to recognize your coworkers' birthday.

If your Facebook friends with your coworkers, you can add a webcal feed of your friends' birthdays to your calendar, and many HR systems let you do the same. At the very least, you can ask for their birth month and day with minimal awkwardness.

### Work anniversaries

Another easy way to show that you appreciate your fellow humans is to recognize their work anniversary. At GitHub, we call these Hubberversaries. When you hit your one, two, five, or ten year work milestone, that's something to be celebrated, even if it rarely is, and most reports would appreciate a quick note letting them know why you're glad they're there.

This is especially true if you're at a younger company. When you've clocked three years at a five year startup, given stereotypical exponential growth, it's almost guaranteed you've been at the company significantly longer than most of your coworkers. Heck, even if you're at a century+ old blue chip, there's a good chance they've been marking work anniversaries with gold watches for decades.

If you're connected with your coworker on LinkedIn (yeah, I know), the service will send you push notifications for your connections work milestones, but I don't recommend it. The easier route is to check internal social tools (at GitHub we have a blog-like platform called Team), or external announcements (for years we announced every new hire).

### Major lifecycle events (e.g., moving)

The final easy way to show your fellow humans that you appreciate them as humans is to recognize when they tell you about major lifecycle events. This can be anything as small as taking on a new hobby, or as big as shipping a human, a house, or a husband/wife.

This is especially true if your company's distributed. If everyone's onsite, it's easy to bump into someone at the water cooler, see their wedding ring, ask how their weekend was, and learn that not only do they have a son, but that he's into tee-ball. When there's no water cooler or no desk to walk by and see pictures, that interaction becomes significantly harder.

As a manager this may be them asking about how to update their address because they just bought their first house, or about health insurance or time off because they're getting married. As a peer, It could as simple as canceling a weekly meeting because they're checking schools. Whatever it is, a small something (a candle, a book, heck, even baby swag) will go a long way to showing you care.
