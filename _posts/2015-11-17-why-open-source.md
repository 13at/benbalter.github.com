There are many reasons why you might consider consuming, publishing, collaborating on, or supporting open source.

### Microeconomic

Open source is in your best interest, whether you're a corporation, a small business, a non-profit, or a government agency. GitHub Cofounder Tom Preston-Werner lays this argument out best in his post [Open Source (Almost) Everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html).
