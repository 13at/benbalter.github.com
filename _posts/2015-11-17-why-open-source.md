title: Why open source
description:

Open source is awesome. There are many reasons why you might consider consuming, publishing, collaborating on, or supporting open source. Here's a few:

### Microeconomic

Open source is in your best interest, whether you're a corporation, a small business, a non-profit, or a government agency.

* **Shift developers from low-value work to high-value work** - We like to say in open source that *All the easy problems have already been solved*. Blogging, content management, and operating systems are all problems with established open source solutions, to name a few. While your developers could spend their time reinventing wheels, it's far preferable to use the worlds best wheel, when that wheel is freely available. This frees developers up to work on yet-unsolved challenges, the types of chalenges that are unique to, or add value to your organization.

* [**Adopt modern software development practices**] (http://ben.balter.com/2015/09/21/open-source-behind-the-firewall/)
* **[With thousands of eyes, all bugs are shallow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law)

GitHub Cofounder Tom Preston-Werner lays out some additional arguments in his post [Open Source (Almost) Everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html).
