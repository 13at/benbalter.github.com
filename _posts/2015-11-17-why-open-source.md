title: Why open source

Open source is awesome. There are many reasons why you might consider consuming, publishing, collaborating on, or supporting open source. Here's a few:

### Microeconomic

Open source is in your best interest, whether you're an individual, a corporation, a small business, a non-profit, or a government agency.

* **Shift developers from low-value work to high-value work** - We like to say in open source that *All the easy problems have already been solved*. Blogging, content management, and operating systems are all problems with established (and mainstream) open source solutions, to name a few. While your developers could spend their time reinventing wheels that the open source community have already perfected, it's far preferable to use the worlds best wheel, especially when that wheel is free. This frees developers up to work on yet-unsolved challenges, the types of challenges that are unique to, or add value to your organization's mission. Why not stand on the shoulders of technology giants?

* **Lower total cost of ownership** (TCO) - Using open source software yields a lower total cost of ownership when compared to closed source and proprietary alternatives. Adopting open source software generally has a lower up-front cost, and shifts the cost center from licensing (an operational expense) to customization and implementation (a capital expense), along with maintenance and support. Implementation and support are sunk costs. You're going to be paying for both regardless of if the software is open or closed source (the cost often being baked into the license). What makes open source unique is that the intellectual property comes at no cost to you.

* [**Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law) (Linus's Law) - When you write closed source software, the only developers that can potentially detect, diagnose, triage, and resolve software bugs are

GitHub Cofounder Tom Preston-Werner lays out some additional arguments in his post [Open Source (Almost) Everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html).

* Great advertising
* Force multiplier
* Attract talent
* Best technical interview possible
* Retain talent
* Modular
* Reduce duplication of effort

### Macroeconomic

* All the easy problems have already been solved
* Stand on the shoulders of giants
* Shift firms from low-value work to high-value work
* Fancy name from @bkeepers blog post about standing on the shoulders of giants

### Moral

* Free as in speech, not as in beer
* Obligation to give back
* Open source as teaching

### Transparency

* Gov: As relies increasingly on tech for citz. services, eseential to check work
* Private: Voting machines, self driving cars

### Participatory
