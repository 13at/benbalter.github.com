title: Moderating a controversial pull request

Pull requests are a great way to collaborate. Propose a specific change, get detailed, concrete feedback from all relevant stakeholders, reach a general consensus, merge. At least that's how it's supposed to work. Sometimes, if you're not careful, things can get a bit off the rails.

Depending on how you use pull requests within your own organization(s), there's a good chance you've seen it before: One commenter leaves a critical drive-by opinion, never to be heard from again. Another raises a tangentially related pet issue that derails the discussion. A third will disagree with everything you propose just on principle. The conversation quickly devolves into a debate on semantics.

It doesn't have to be that way. If you're about to open a controversial (or wide-reaching) pull request, there are a handful of steps you can take to encourage a more productive discussion:

### Lay out the ground rules upfront

First and foremost, lay out the ground rules up front. This can either be in the body of the issue itself, or someplace more global, like the repository's README or CONTRIBUTING file. If the conversation is occurring within a finite group, e.g., a company or an open source project, it may make sense to curate those rules alongside other policy documents, and to seek to integrate them within your organization's culture more broadly.

#### Keep it civil

Although often less of a concern for pull requests within an organization, the broader internet is a scary place. Make it clear that participants need to keep it classy, and link out to a code of conduct or similar guidelines.

#### No place for the peanut gallery

* If you don't care strongly enough to open a PR and propose an alternative, shouldn't be commenting

* But see, raises the barrier to entry for non-technical users

### Describe how you want feedback

Questions or pull requests

### Set a timeline

### Assign a moderator

### Make the decider known
