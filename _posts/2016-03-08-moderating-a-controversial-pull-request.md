title: Moderating a controversial pull request
description: If you're about to open a controversial (or wide-reaching) issue or pull request, there are a handful of steps you can take to set yourself up for success.

Pull requests are a great way to collaborate. Propose a specific change, get detailed, concrete feedback from all relevant stakeholders, reach a general consensus, and merge. At least that's how it's supposed to work. Sometimes, if you're not careful, things can get a bit off the rails. Depending on how you use pull requests within your own organization(s), there's a good chance you've seen it before: One commenter leaves a critical drive-by opinion, then is never heard from again. Another raises a tangentially related pet issue that derails the discussion. A third will disagree with everything you propose on principle. The conversation quickly devolves into a debate on semantics.

It doesn't have to be that way. If you're about to open a controversial (or wide-reaching) pull request, there are a handful of steps you can take to encourage a more product discussion:

### Layout the ground rules upfront

First and foremost, lay the ground rules up front. This can either be in the body of the issue itself, or someplace more global, like the repository's readme or contributing file.

* No place for the peanut gallery
* If you don't care strongly enough to open a PR and propose an alternative, shouldn't be commenting
* But see, raises the barrier to entry for non-technical users

### Describe how you want feedback

Questions or pull requests

### Set a timeline

### Assign a moderator

### Make the decider known
