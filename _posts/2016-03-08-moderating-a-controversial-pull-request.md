title: Moderating a controversial pull request
description: If you're about to open a controversial (or wide-reaching) issue or pull request, there are a handful of steps you can take to set yourself up for success.

Pull requests are a great way to collaborate. Propose a specific change, get detailed, concrete feedback from all relevant stakeholders, reach a general consensus, merge. At least that's how it's supposed to work, but sometimes, if you're not careful, things can go a bit off the rails.

Depending on how you use pull requests within your own organization, there's a good chance you've seen it before: one commenter leaves a critical drive-by opinion, never to be heard from again. Another raises a tangentially related pet issue that derails the discussion. A third will disagree with just about everything you propose, just on principle. The conversation quickly devolves into a debate of semantics, and things go nowhere fast.

It doesn't have to be that way. If you're about to open a controversial (or wide-reaching) pull request, there are a handful of steps you can take to encourage a more productive discussion:

### Lay out the ground rules upfront

First and foremost, lay out the ground rules up front. This can either be in the body of the issue itself, or someplace more global, like the repository's README or CONTRIBUTING file. If the conversation is occurring within a finite group, e.g., a company or an open source project, it may make sense to curate those rules alongside other organization-wide policy documents, and to seek to integrate them within your organization's culture more broadly.

#### Keep it civil

Although often less of a concern for pull requests within an organization, the broader internet is a scary place. Make it clear that participants need to keep it classy, and link out to a code of conduct or similar guidelines.

#### No place for the peanut gallery

* But see, raises the barrier to entry for non-technical users

### Describe how you want feedback

Make it clear how people should provide feedback. Should they post long-winded, general comments? Directed questions by quoting specific passages? Comment in line on the particular section? Submit a pull request with the suggested improvements? Whatever you do, for your own sanity, choose *one* means of discussion, rather than two or three, and prefer targeted suggestions, to general critiques.

### Set a timeline

Let everyone involved know how long you're going to allow for discussion (and make sure it's tantamount to the subject matter). Is this a 24-hour discussion? A week's worth? A month? Are there milestones or checkpoints along the way to make certain decisions or roll out certain aspects? The timeframe should be long enough such that relevant stakeholders are on notice and can participate, even if they're away for their keyboard at any given moment, but not so long as to inject undue delay into the process. 

### Assign a moderator

### Make the decider known
