If you're a government agency trying to attract technical talent to your innovation efforts, posting job descriptions for positions named "Technology Specialist — Internet"[^funny-story] may not be enough. The type of private-sector technologists you're after are used to a very different workplace. It's not a matter of privilege or a private/public divide. Startups long-ago learned that innovative efforts require innovative atmospheres, and when they arrive in the beltway, they're in for a bit of culture shock.

When creating an atmosphere conducive to innovation, pay attention to how much time technologists will need to spend fighting for the right to work they want to work, versus actually just working. With that in mind, here's 18 reasons why private-sector change agents may not want to work at your agency:

1. **Tools designed for lawyers** — At most agencies, technologists will be given the same hardware (computer, phone, etc.) as would be given to attorneys and other non-technical civil servants. Not all knowledge workers have the same needs. While a lawyer may live primarily in Outlook and Microsoft Word, developers spend the bulk of their time writing and compiling software, a task significantly easier on unix-based systems like Macs which more closely mirror production environments and are optimized for creative arts. Before I can write a single function or draw a single line, it's likely I'll be forced to justify why I should be able to use the computer of my choice.

1. **Distrust of employees** - You'd be hard-pressed to find an agency IT department that would give a developer full-dominion over their workspace. When it comes to IT security, developers are distinct from the average employee in two ways: first, as engineers, they often have a critical understanding of the software we use on a daily basis, how it works, and how others might try to exploit it. As a result, although not entirely immune, software developers are less likely to fall pray to the types of traps system-level IT restrictions are designed to prevent. Second, while the average employee may primarily use one-or-two consumer applications that can be easily installed during on boarding, a developer's daily workflow often requires low-level system access — installing or upgrading development libraries, running local test servers, or compiling common frameworks — tasks impossible when an agency doesn't trust developers enough to make them the administrator of their own machine.

1. **Being tethered** - At most government agencies WiFi is the exception, not the norm. Many government IT departments hold on to outdated preconceptions that WiFi isn't secure, or the agency simply failed to make the necessary investment a few years back, and is not behind the curve. WiFi will never be as secure as plugging directly into a hard-wired connection, but there's a trade-off to be made in terms of the ability to bring rich media into meetings, or have conversations somewhere other than one's desk. Most startups look physically nothing like government agencies, and for good reason. The ability to roam cross-polinates ideas and breads creativity. While you don't have to go out and buy bean bag chairs, allowing internet-centric technologists to untether from their desk is a great firs step.

1. **Strange service-providers** - If you go into a technical interview in San Francisco, they're going to ask you if you're familiar with services like Heroku, AWS, Travis, or GitHub. There's a small set of industry-standard tools that most companies use, and when hiring, they'd prefer you know how to use their existing toolchain, rather than have to teach what the industry's already settled on. In government, most of those tools are almost unheard of, being replaced by government-specific imitations. As a developer, I'd likely either have to unlearn what the rest of the world uses, or spend time making the case for why the agency should use the industry-standard cloud services.

1. **Temporary integration** - In most companies (let alone open source project's) it's sacrilege to commit a change without an accompanying test. As software projects get increasingly complex, standard QA in the form of "open up the browser and see if it works" isn't sufficient. Even if it is, developers need to be confident that when they make a change, they can do so knowing they didn't break existing functionality. For many this function is accomplished by a process known as continuous integration. Every time a change is proposed, a server runs thousands of tests to give the developer instant feedback. Yet in government, continuous integration is still a "we'd like to be there" development concept, with services like Jenkins or Travis being rarely used in government.

1. **Sparse delivery** — Continuous delivery is the idea that you should be constantly deploying small iterations of code, lines at a time. Unlike say, software that's that's distributed as a CD or installed by end-users, websites and other service-based offerings aren't' versioned in the same way, and thus the cost of an update is negligible. Rather than wait for an all-or-nothing update from 1.0, 2.0, continuous delivery lets you incrementally test each change one-by-one, lessoning the risk of catastrophic failure (as an example, what version of Gmail are you using today?). A private sector firm might measure deploys per day or even deploys per hour, and still be unsatisfied. In government, there's no need to measured deploys as they are scheduled well ahead of time, by day or by week, as each change must be reviewed by stringing change control boards which hold standing meetings for just such a purpose.

1. **Waterfall is an option** — There's no question that agile development is the hot new thing in government, but that doesn't mean that it's the default. Traditional waterfall development is still considered a viable option, with both procurement processes and agency policy encouraging large-batch development efforts. Developers want to move quickly, and want to be part of a team that moves as quickly as they do.

1. **Process isn't valued** — The final deliverable for multi-million dollar contracts is an email with a zipped attachment of the code; agencies often don't have day-to-day visibility into the project's progress (read: version control and shared issue tracking)

1. **Guilty until proven innocent** — Modern frameworks are assumed to be insecure unless I prove otherwise (Rails, Node, even PHP are looked at as too immature compared Sharepoint, Coldfusion, etc.)

1. **Open source as a verb** — Open source is still something you do, not who you are or how you work

1. Working in the open is a novelty, not a best practice
1. Speaking at conferences is tightly controlled by a non-technical public affairs office
1. Unless they transition to management, geeks are always the bottom of the bureaucratic food chain regardless of seniority or skill
1. Agencies don't trust their employees
1. Culture only happens outside of working hours (lunch, happy hour)
1. If you're passionate about a specific topic, ethics restrictions make it difficult to transition to/from the private sector
1. The hiring process is measured in months, is opaque and arms-length
1. Recruitment is almost unheard of
1. Restricted internet
1. Developers can't touch servers
