title: How not to prioritize a feature
description:
---

### Someone is willing to build it

### Sales says a big/potential customer is asking for it

### Your friend asked for it

### It's easy to do it

### Our competitor does it

### A squeaky wheel asked for it

### A handful of power users asked for this

### The theme makes sense in terms of your product vision
