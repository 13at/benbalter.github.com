title: How not to prioritize a feature
description:
---

Sometimes great ideas, customer needs, product priorities, and engineering resources align. Sometimes a feature is so simple, that it makes more sense just to implement than to take the time to prioritize or sequence it. In my experience, those two cases represent the vast minority of features, and in a world of near-endless possibilities, the hardest part of software development is not deciding what feature you should build, but instead, what features will have the biggest impact. Here's ____ anti-patterns I've seen both in open and closed source, for prioritizing feature requests:

### Someone is willing to build it

In less formal organizations (open source projects included), the biggest barrier to entry is finding someone with the skills necessary to solve an identified problem. Open source issue trackers are replete with "this is a great idea if anyone willing to submit a pull request"-type issues. The same is true of non-developer stakeholders and closed source projects, with lawyers, support reps, and marketers shopping around ideas internally in hopes of finding someone willing to implement them.

Maybe the idea comes from a developer who's experienced the problem themselves. Maybe the external issue or internal ask makes its way in front of a sympathetic engineer willing to dedicate a few cycles. Granted, there will always be no-brainers and quick wins, but in most cases, "someone is willing to do this", should not necessarily translate to "we should do this".

### Sales says a lot of/a big/a potential customer is asking for it

Your Sales team is one of your most robust means of getting feedback from customers. If an existing or potential customer has a suggestion, it's in everyone's best interest for that idea to be communicated via the sales rep to those who are in a position to implement it. But it's all too easy to confuse that which you hear most often, or that which your hear most loudly, with that which is most important. Product development and project management is neither a democracy nor a pure customer oligarchy.

Your users are experts at using your product, not building, supporting, or maintaining it. Feedback via your sales channels should be one of your primary means of understanding user challenges, but it should not be your primary means of feature definition or prioritization, nor should it be your only means of feedback.

### Your friend asked for it

People in technology tend to have friends in technology. It's not uncommon for friends to be users, and for conversations at meetups, over dinner, or during happy hour to turn to talking shop. Nobody wants to disappoint someone they respect, and showing that you listened to their advice or were in a position to implement their suggestion is a proven recipe to garner admiration.

Unless you're building a product for developers, it's unlikely that your friends are your target audience, and even if you're are, they're not going to be representative of both current and potential users. Friends can be the source of some of your most honest, direct, and immediate critical feedback, but keep in mind that one data point does not create a pattern.

### It's easy to do it



### Our competitor does it

### A squeaky wheel asked for it

### A handful of power users asked for this

### The theme makes sense in terms of your product vision
