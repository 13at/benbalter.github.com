If you're a government agency your first opens source project is likely going to be a flop. In all fairness, [your organization has been set up](http://ben.balter.com/2014/08/03/why-isnt-all-government-software-open-source/) to fail. Participating in the open source community bares little relationship to the process your agency has established, like those required to publish a press release or manage a Facebook page. Open source is an animal unlike one you've ever seen.

### The typical startup hockeystick

In startup land, new products are introduced to the market with an adoption curve that resembles a typical hockey stick. At first only a handful of early adopters kick the tires, things grow in at a linear rate, until a critical mass is achieved, and growth explodes exponentially, often with no end in sight. You can see this phenomenon in [the adoption of open source by government employees](https://github.com/blog/1874-government-opens-up-10k-active-government-users-on-github). Even when an established firm brings a new product (or even a feature) to market, it's done in a phased way to artificially emulate this same adoption curve. You've likely seen startups launch a new product in "private beta", but it also happens behind the scenes every day in ways you likely don't know (by design).

Government on the other hand, almost always adopts a reverse hockey stick approach to new initiatives, technical or otherwise. Take the launch of `healthcare.gov` as an example. On day one, demand is seemingly endless, interest decays exponentially over the following months, and there's a long tail of linear decline as the site exists in perpetuity. Embarking on a new open source project is not to indifferent, and without a different strategy, the results are likely to be the same.

### Software that's too big to fail

When starting your first open source project, there are lots of firsts for lots of people. For developers, it may be the first time users, especially technical users scrutinize their code. For project managers, it may be the fist time adoptin ga more open, more iterative workflow. For lawyers it may be the first time advising the agency on entire software IP regimes. For the security team it may be the first time doing collaborative code reviews. And for the public affairs office, it may be the first time directly engaging the developer community, trolls and all. For your first open source project to be a success a lot of one-in-a-million chances need to go right. In fact, they all do.

Almost without exception, up until this point, government has preferred to wait until something is absolutely perfect before it could be made public, policy, code, or otherwise. Think about it logically. If you're writing a law, or a treaty, you'd better hope you got it right before it goes into effect. I'd argue that the private sector has the same "can't afford to fail" mindset, arguably even more justifiably so (it take a lot for a government agency to go out of business). Government agencies are also incentivized to maximize batch size (once again, encouraging "too big too fail" initiatives). If getting one line of code into production takes six weeks of change control board reviews and getting 10,000 lines of code into production takes the same six weeks, logic dictates that change batches should be as large as possible.

### Ship 0.1 not 1.0

The most effective way to hedge the risk of too-big-too fail software is through iteration. In the open source world, that means that when starting something new, you should :ship: version 0.1 (the minimum viable version of the thing you're trying to create), not 1.0 (what you're hoping to :ship:). So long as you communicate the projects status (e.g., "it's a prototype", "it's a proof-of-concept"), the community can respond accordingly. Once you've gotten real-world, production-grade feedback, you can add additional functionality in 0.2, and eventually ship the 1.0 you originally wanted.

The irony is, government agencies often initially ship software that would be called 0.1 anyplace outside of government, but give it the self-proclaimed badge of 1.0 quality, both internally and externally. But in reality, that's not the case.

### Think small, then think even smaller

Successful forays into open source begin not with large, flagship initiatives, but with small, nobody-will-notice-if-they-fail efforts. In fact, the story often starts well before a single line of code leaves the firewall. There's a lot of organizational pistons that need to fire in perfect timing for open source to work. Prime them with an open source excercise. Create a list of the
