title: Removing a feature is a feature

Features aren't what make a product great. Solving a user's needs does.

Your users use your product because [they're trying to solve a specific problem](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/). It could be getting from point A to point B, finding their next romantic interest, or having some place to store their vacation photos. Whatever reason, they have a specific task in mind, and your product is simply the most effective tool to accomplish it, at least, that's the idea.

### Features aren't free

Features come with a very real cost to users. We have a phrase a GitHub, that "*everything added dilutes everything else*". Every time you add a dropdown, a toggle, or a tab, your increasing the cognitive burden required to accomplish the task the user set out to accomplish. Even if they're never going to use the feature, they still have to learn what the feature does, how it relates to the task at hand, and if they should use it. And with every new feature, they'll need to go through that process all over again.

In the short run, that cognitive burden steepens in the learning curve for new users. In the long run, it could create a paralysis of choice whereby even power users are overwhelmed by the number of options (or simply don't learn how to use them in the first place). Each time you add a feature you're also creating an implicit contract with the user, that that feature will work in perpetuity, even as the product changes.

* Why make decisions
  * You are the subject matter expert
  * Absorb complexity on behalf of users

* Don't add the feature in the first place
  * Reaction to custom request (sales)
  * Scope creep
  * Scratching a technical itch
  * Not understanding customer's need
