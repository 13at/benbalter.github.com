Features aren't what make a product great. Being the best at solving a problem is what makes a product great. Every time you remove a feature that doesn't support your product's core use case, you're adding a feature that does.

Your users use your product because [they're trying to solve a specific problem](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/). It could be getting from point A to point B, finding their next romantic interest, or having some place to store their vacation photos. Whatever reason, they have a specific task in mind, and your product is simply the most effective tool to accomplish it, at least, that's the idea. That means that every feature that doesn't solve the problem they're trying to solve, isn't just product cruft, it's actively standing their way.

### Features aren't free

Features come with a very real cost to users. As [I wrote a few months back](http://ben.balter.com/2016/03/08/optimizing-for-power-users-and-edge-cases/):

> We have a motto at GitHub, part of the [GitHub Zen](http://ben.balter.com/2015/08/12/the-zen-of-github/), that "*anything added dilutes everything else*". In reality, there is always a non-zero cost to adding that extra option. Most immediately, it's the time you spend building feature A, instead of building feature B. A bit beyond that, it's the cognitive burden you've just added to each user's onboarding experience as they try to grok how to use the thing you've added (and if they should). In the long run, it's much more than maintenance. Complexity begets complexity, meaning each edge case you account for today, creates many more edge cases down the line.

> The WordPress community [has a similar philosophy](https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/), "*decisions not options*." Every time you provide a user with an option, you're asking them to make a decision, and [those decisions quickly add up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis), especially when the user doesn't care or doesn't fully understand the implications. Ultimately, many of these decisions are technical or domain-specific decisions, and as a project maintainer, as the subject-matter expert, it's your obligation to absorb all that complexity on behalf of your users, not to simply kick the decision can down the line.

Every time you add a dropdown, a toggle, or a tab, your increasing the cognitive burden required to accomplish the task your user is using your product to accomplish. Even if they're never going to use the feature, they still have to learn what the feature does, how it relates to the task at hand, and decide if they should use it. And with every new feature you add, they'll need to go through that process all over again, not to mention, that new knob is going to make it harder to find the knob they're actually looking for.

### Decisions over options

The WordPress community has a similar philosophy, “decisions not options.” Every time you provide a user with an option, you’re asking them to make a decision, and those decisions quickly add up, especially when the user doesn’t care or doesn’t fully understand the implications. Ultimately, many of these decisions are technical or domain-specific decisions, and as a project maintainer, as the subject-matter expert, it’s your obligation to absorb all that complexity on behalf of your users, not to simply kick the decision can down the line.

* Why make decisions
  * You are the subject matter expert
  * Absorb complexity on behalf of users

* Don't add the feature in the first place
  * Reaction to custom request (sales)
  * Scope creep
  * Scratching a technical itch
  * Not understanding customer's need
