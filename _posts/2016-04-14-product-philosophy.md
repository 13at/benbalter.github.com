### Absorb complexity on behalf of users

The internet's a complicated place, and most websites don't make it any better. Products should strive to be user-centric. Your job as a creator is to engineer simplicity, to leverage technology to reduce the cognitive burden of accomplishing whatever task your user is trying to accomplish (for which using the thing you built is just a necessary step along the way). Every time you add a toggle, dropdown, or text box, you're pushing complexity on your users, and you're adding another decision, that they wouldn't have to make if they didn't use your product.

### Optimize for the ideal use case, not the most common

If a user can do something with the product, they will. That's a lot of unexpected uses, and as result, a lot of unanticipated feature requests. Regardless of how the product is actually being used, push users in the right direction. Encourage them to do the thing you want them to do. This means building features that support your ideal use case, not the most common, the one used by the loudest part of the user base or the squeakiest wheel.

###  Build features 80% of users will use

[It's easy (and fun) to optimize for power users and solve for edge cases](http://ben.balter.com/2016/03/08/optimizing-for-power-users-and-edge-cases/). The real challenge, for any product, lies in genuinely nailing the out-of-box experience for 80% of users. As a geek, it’s always going to be more fun to develop the new wiz-bang feature that will allow the app to integrate with whatever’s currently on the top of Hacker News and as a project maintainer, it’s always going to feel better to ship code and mark an issue as resolved, than to close yet another issue as `wontfix`. At the same time, power users typically are the ones most invested in your product, and thus the most likely to be vocal. Adding a setting is easy. Burying that setting in the endless clutter of an “advanced” tab is even easier. Forego the temptation to inch your project one step closer to the inside of an airplane cockpit.
