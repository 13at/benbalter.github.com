If you've been around software long enough, there's a good chance that you've heard the term "*bikeshedding*." Bikeshedding is the idea that given the opportunity, people will comment on a proposed idea, and that they will comment on the parts of the idea that they understand (not necessarily the parts that require the greatest scrutiny).

For example, if you propose building a bike shed, those interested will dig their heels in on what color you should paint the shed, not its structure, size, or location. The idea [traces back to a post on a Linux mailing list nearly two decades ago](http://bikeshed.com/):

> [J]ust because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one... because you do not like the color they plan to paint it... you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so.

### Parkinson's law of triviality

Bikeshedding is an application of the broader [Parkinson's law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), the idea that "members of an organization give disproportionate weight to trivial issues". For example:

> [It's easy to imagine] a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bike shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important but also a far more difficult and complex task.

You've likely seen it before when presenting to a committee or to higher-ups. You spend months putting together the proposal, and when you ask for questions at the end of your presentation, they fixate on one or two minor details.

Part of this stems from Parkinson's law, but part of this also stems from corporate social norms. If you spend 45 minutes giving a presentation, ask for feedback, and those to whom you were presenting have nothing to say, others might think they weren't listening (or worse, have nothing to add).

### Honeypots

If you've been around software long enough, there's also a good chance that you've heard the term "*honeypot*". Honeypots come in many forms from Tom Clancy novels to real-life KGB operations, but in computer security, a honeypot is essentially an electronic sting operation.

A honeypot is something that looks attractive (and real), but is ultimately fictional and designed to ensnarl the attacker. You might, for example, add a field to a form that's only visible to computers, in hopes of detecting automated submissions, or add an easily hackable but fake server to a network, in hopes of detecting intruders.

If you know those to whom you're presenting need to say *something*, and know the type of thing they're most likely to comment on, why not then, provide them opportunities to do just that.

### An old idea with a new name

The idea of a "bikeshed honeypot" (as I'm calling it) isn't new. The earliest reference I can find is [an MSDN blog from 2005](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brada/2005/05/13/the-admirals-pipe/) where it was called "The Admiralâ€™s Pipe", the idea being that Russian submariners would leave one, fairly obvious, pipe un-cleaned prior to their admiral's inspection. As the Microsoft manager put it, "[t]he admiral would find this pipe, insist that it be cleaned and feel satisfied that he found a problem and not dig any deeper."

The idea resurfaced in 2010 on [a now defunct StackOverflow thread](http://www.stackprinter.com/questions/new-programming-jargon-you-coined.html) (made popular by [Coding Horror in 2012](https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/)) as "a duck", the legend of a game developer who perfectly animated the game's queen character, but then unceremoniously added an easily removable pet duck to every scene for the producer to criticism (and ultimately remove).

Heck, there's even a Dilbert comic about it (with a unique twist):
