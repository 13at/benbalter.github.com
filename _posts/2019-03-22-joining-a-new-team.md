title: Go near, go far, and meet in the middle

There's been a number of times in my career where I've been fortunate enough to join an existing engineering team. Most often it's that they've operated without a product manager as the organization grew and matured, but it could be that your joining a team that previously had a product manager with a different approach or product philosophy. Regardless of the reason, you're likely to immediatly find yourself in issue triage mode with engineers looking towards you for guidance, clarity, and prioritization. Where do you start?

### Go near

Almost without exception, there's always certain bugs, features, or tech. debt that the team _knows_ they want to (or need to) address. Start there. Those user stories likely won't require much product resources beyond affirmation, and the engineering team can start making forward progress while you fully scrub in to the problem space.

### Go far

From there, think big. Where do you want the product to be in a year or two? Socialize a shared vision for where the product _should_ be, absent technical constraints. The process will take different forms depending on the organization, but the end goal should be a written and agreed upon mission/vision/end state the team team is striving to achieve _from a user's perspective_. The idea is that you should identify the problems you'd like to solve and what they look like to be solved (but not how to solve them).

### Meet in the middle

After that, it's a matter of meeting in the middle. How can you get from where you are today to where you all agree the product should go? This is where solutions (and solution validation) comes in. Depending on the scale, this can take the form of qualitative and quantitative research, solution discovery, breaking big ideas into discrete tasks, roadmapping, iterating and getting user feedback, or prioritizing and sequencing.
