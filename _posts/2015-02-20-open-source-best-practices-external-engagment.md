title: "Five best practices in open source: internal collaboration"

Before you can open source, you must first learn to collaborate. [Open source is not a verb](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/15/open-source-is-not-a-verb/). It's a workflow, a philosophy, a modern approach to software development. To think you can [breed code in captivity behind a firewall](http://ben.balter.com/2013/05/14/we-ve-been-selling-open-source-wrong/), using closed, hostile, or waterfall methodologies, and that once that code leaves the firewall, it will grow wings, is a  misunderstanding of what it means to participate in the open source community.

Working regularly with government agencies to help ensure their first (or second) step into the open source world is a successful one, here are five best practices for pursuing open source in government (or any large organization for that matter):

### 1. The technology is the easy part

Whether you realize it or not, when you embark on your organization's (or your team's) first open source project, you're likely going to be using open source as a vehicle for organizational change. From a practical standpoint, open source is a solved problem. It's not a question of if you can publish the source code, if you could stand up a forum to collect feedback, or if you could track changes to the code over time. Geeks have been doing open source for decades at this point. You can assume it's *possible*.

The true challenge is whether or not you can foster the  culture necessary internal to support your open source project externally. Put another way, you can’t be a closed source culture behind the firewall, and expect to foster an open source culture in public. Successful open source projects begin well before the first line of code is ever written, let alone published. The way your organization works internally will necessarily be a mirror image of how your organization works externally. Before you embark on your first open source project (whether as an agency, a company, a business unit, or a team), spend a few cycles improving your own internal workflows. Put another way, bad collaboration is bad collaboration, regardless of how closely held or widely shared the code is.

### 2. Start small, go through the motions

There's an anti-pattern within government that when an agency decides to start participating in the open source community, they bet big and do it with a flagship initiative, often with a strong policy component at stake. In reality, [your first open source project is likely going to be a flop](http://ben.balter.com/2015/02/11/why-your-first-open-source-project-is-going-to-be-a-dud/).

You wouldn’t run a marathon without training first, would you? Like your body, organizations have muscle memory. You've most likely encountered [the organization's subconscious "no" muscle reflex](http://ben.balter.com/2014/03/21/want-to-innovate-in-government-focus-on-culture/#bureaucracy-is-an-organism). If the organism doesn't recognize the antibodies of a new idea, it will attack it as a means of self preservation. Introducing open source is no exception. Most stakeholders will say "no" at first glance, and not on the proposal's merit.

Instead, start by experimenting by collaborating openly, but in private, within the safety of your team or organization. Create a list of best lunch places near your office or the team's favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Go through the motions of collaborating and master the basics when it doesn't matter if you make a mistake. Then get other stakeholders involved, legal, procurement, ethics, everyone.

Your first open source release should be something small and inconsequential, not a flagship initiative. Find a few lines of your website's front end code, a plugin you use in your CMS, or a previously release mobile app. Get that open source 0.1 out the door, before waiting on (and learning from your mistakes as you ship) a 1.0 Your goal is to ensure all the organization's cylinders are firing in sync when it comes to open source, and to go through the motions of open source, with a bit of help from training wheels.

### 3. Minimize information imbalance

Open source is about  growing a community. Often when we think about project stakeholders (and build or adopt workflows), we only look to those within our organization. When it comes to open source, you *must* ensure that those outside the firewall are on equal footing — in terms of information and ability to influence the project — as those outside the firewall. Developers are people too.

The default government workflow is to hold synchronous, meatspace meeting in wood-paneled, formerly smoke-filled rooms. Like a bad joke, you "had to be there" in order to be in on it. That's not how you foster a strong open source project.

Imagine this: you maintain an open source project. A contributor spends a week building our a new feature they want to see incorporated and propose it. You as the maintainer, have to turn them down, because either you've been secretly tracking a change internally that will solve the problem, or worse, have had secret discussions internally that you want to take the project in a different direction. You'd better bet that contributor is never contributing to your project ever again (or any other project for that matter).

The way you hedge against this risk is by working outside the firewall, by leveling the information playing field and placing your internal stakeholders on the same footing as all other project stakeholders. Not only does that simplify (and modernize) your own workflows, but it ensures that there's an information balance.

This idea comes into play in three distinct ways:

* **Procedurally** that means maintaining one issue tracker (that's public), rather than keeping a secret priority list that only you can see. That also means that stakeholders (again, whether internal or external) should have one mechanism to provide feedback or discuss new features. Last, minimize and memorialize meatspace discussions when absolutely necessary.

* **Day-to-day** that means communicating the project's status (proof of concept, actively developed, deprecated, etc.) as well as how to submit an issue, propose a feature, or contribute a fix or enhancement.

* **Long-term**  that means documenting (and open sourcing) the project's mission statement, philosophy, goals, features and requirements list, and overall project roadmap.

### 4. Embrace the constraints of open source

* Electronic - High fidelity mediums expose process
* Transparent Communicate decisions in realtime, and forever
* Asynchronous Focus workflow on code, not meetings
* Informal Adopt cultures, not polices

### 5. Open source problems, not solutions

* Developers want to  contribute to a cause  not provide free labor
* “Yes we can”, not “yes we did”
* If you’re happy with your ship, you’ve shipped too late
