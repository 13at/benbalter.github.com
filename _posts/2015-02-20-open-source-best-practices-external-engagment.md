Excerpt: ""
---

### 1. The technology is the easy part

* Open source as a vehicle for organizational change
* You can’t be a closed source culture behind the firewall, and expect to foster an open source culture in public

### 2. Start small, go through the motions

* You wouldn’t run a marathon without training
* Organizations have muscle memory
* Open source is scary (they will say “no” at first)
* Start by experimenting with “open source” in private  (Best lunch places near your office, the office’s favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe)
* Get everyone involved  (legal, procurement, ethics, etc.)
* Ship 0.1, not 1.0  (and manage expectation)

### 3. Minimize information imbalance

* Open source is about  growing a community
* Developers are people too
* Work outside the firewall
* Procedurally  (One issue tracker, one way to provide feedback or discuss features; minimize and memorialize
meatspace discussions)
* Day-to-day  (The project’s status, how to submit an issue/feature request or contribute a fix/enhancement)
* Long-term  (Project mission statement, philosophy, and goal, features and requirements list, project roadmap)

### 4. Embrace the constraints of open source

* Electronic - High fidelity mediums expose process
* Transparent Communicate decisions in realtime, and forever
* Asynchronous Focus workflow on code, not meetings
* Informal Adopt cultures, not polices

### 5. Open source problems, not solutions

* Developers want to  contribute to a cause  not provide free labor
* “Yes we can”, not “yes we did”
* If you’re happy with your ship, you’ve shipped too late
