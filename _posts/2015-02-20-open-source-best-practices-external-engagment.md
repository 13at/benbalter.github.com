title: "Five best practices in open source: internal collaboration"

Before you can open source, you must first learn to collaborate. [Open source is not a verb](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/15/open-source-is-not-a-verb/). It's a workflow, a philosophy, a modern approach to software development. To think you can [breed code in captivity behind a firewall](http://ben.balter.com/2013/05/14/we-ve-been-selling-open-source-wrong/), using closed, hostile, or waterfall methodologies, and that once that code leaves the firewall, it will grow wings, is a pernicious misunderstanding of what it means to participate in the open source community.

Successful open source projects begin well behind the corporate firewall, before the first line of code is ever written. The way your organization internally will be a mirror image of how your organization works externally. Before you embark on your first open source project (whether as an agency, a company, a business unit, or a team), spend a few cycles improving your own internal workflows. Bad collaboration is bad collaboration, regardless of how widely the code is shared.

Working regularly with government agencies to help ensure their first (or second) step into the open source world is a successful one, here are five best practices for pursuing open source in government (or any large organization for that matter):

### 1. The technology is the easy part

* Open source as a vehicle for organizational change
* You can’t be a closed source culture behind the firewall, and expect to foster an open source culture in public

### 2. Start small, go through the motions

* You wouldn’t run a marathon without training
* Organizations have muscle memory
* Open source is scary (they will say “no” at first)
* Start by experimenting with “open source” in private  (Best lunch places near your office, the office’s favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe)
* Get everyone involved  (legal, procurement, ethics, etc.)
* Ship 0.1, not 1.0  (and manage expectation)

### 3. Minimize information imbalance

* Open source is about  growing a community
* Developers are people too
* Work outside the firewall
* Procedurally  (One issue tracker, one way to provide feedback or discuss features; minimize and memorialize
meatspace discussions)
* Day-to-day  (The project’s status, how to submit an issue/feature request or contribute a fix/enhancement)
* Long-term  (Project mission statement, philosophy, and goal, features and requirements list, project roadmap)

### 4. Embrace the constraints of open source

* Electronic - High fidelity mediums expose process
* Transparent Communicate decisions in realtime, and forever
* Asynchronous Focus workflow on code, not meetings
* Informal Adopt cultures, not polices

### 5. Open source problems, not solutions

* Developers want to  contribute to a cause  not provide free labor
* “Yes we can”, not “yes we did”
* If you’re happy with your ship, you’ve shipped too late
