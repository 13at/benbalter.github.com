My first talk as a GitHubber

Cluetrain

Users care about solving problems

Jobs to be done

Solution selling

SPIN selling

Problems, not solutions

Why > What

Rules

* Describe 1/4" hole
* Speak from the user's perspective
* Be authentic - Markets are conversations
* Don't sell, inspire
* Adoption isn't the end game
* Rich, not complex
* Nuture a movement

In practice:

* Invite customer feedback
* Seek to understand needs
* Take notes, pull out themes
* Reframe the problem
* Set the scene, introduce the hero
* Make your audience hate the villan
* Hero makes tough choice, defeats villan
* ...happily ever after
