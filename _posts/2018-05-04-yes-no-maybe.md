title: Yes, No, Maybe

I've been a Product Manager at GitHub for a number of years now, but recently, @gnawhleinad and @nayafia introduced me to a framework for responding to feature requests that has changed how I talk about upcoming features (both internally and externally) and that I'd like to share here (in slightly modified form). I call it "Yes, No, Maybe". It looks a little something like this:

* **Yes** - We have committed to implement it in the next three months
* **No** - We have no plans to implement it in the foreseeable future
* **Maybe** - We might implement it down the road, but either need more information or plan to but haven't committed to it yet

When it comes to feature development, I've always been a fan of "under promise, over deliver". The worst place you can find yourself as a Product Manager is promising something to customers (internal or external) that you're unable to deliver.

While customers shouldn't make purchase decisions based on [forward-looking statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-looking_statement), customers nonetheless take comfort in better understanding a product's direction, and what they might be able to expect down the line. At GitHub, we often run into "are you going to build that, or should we?"-type questions from customers, for example.

At the same time, most sufficiently sophisticated engineering organizations either formally think about Product work in terms of quarters, or at least have a rough idea of their product roadmap that extends out about three months out. This three month mark creates a good bright-line where it's safe to say "yes" we're doing that (or are going to soon). Often projects are in flight at this point (or planned and committed to), and even if the exact ship date is unknown, it's likely the project will eventually ship. As a PM you should have high confidence you can say "yes" without violating the customer's expectations down the line.

For those features not on a team's short-term roadmap, you have two choices: If it's something that doesn't make sense for your product strategically, the answer is simple. "No." or "We're not planning on doing that in the foreseeable future", more verbosely. If it's something you'd like to do but haven't yet committed to (e.g., 4+ months out), or something that might make strategic sense but you haven't looked into, you give the best answer you can "maybe". I often follow up "maybe" with more context, e.g., explaining that it's on our medium or long-term roadmap, but that we can't yet commit to it, or explaining that it's a great idea that we should (genuinely) look in to (with a promise to get back to them).
