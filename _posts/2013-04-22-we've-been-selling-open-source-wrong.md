We've been selling open source wrong. Like really, really wrong. At least when it comes to government (and if I had to guess, enterprise as well).

Imagine if tomorrow, 10 developers showed up outside the gates of the White House with pitch forks and battering rams, somehow (peacefully) got inside, and was able to convinced the powers that be to release the code that runs say, The Situation Room.

Do you think once public the project would have much chance of sustainable success in the wild? Even with the code out in the open and a small team of committed open source developers, the White House will still have its own, probably Waterfall-ish workflow, its own, private issue tracker, and most importantly, it's own goals, priorities, and chain of command that the rest of the world wouldn't be privy to. I doubt the software would be very well documented to begin with, so have fun reverse-engineering half the functionality, not to mention, you'd likely be hard pressed to find a wider use case for such purpose-built code which I can only imagine is written in Cold Fusion or some other unfortunate (proprietary) language last seen when Palm Pilots were in vogue. It's still a closed-source project, government by a closed-source philosophy and closed-source tools. The code just happens to be available online.

Making code public is less than half the game. Heck, it's less than 1% of the game. In fact, it's the last thing we should be worrying about. Yet that's exactly what the open government community chooses to fixate on every day â€” lining up at the gate and demanding to see code (just without the torches), asking that an agency open source project X, or release the data behind service Y. It's too late. The damage is already done.

We can make all the arguments we want for why open source produces better, more secure software, how it's already paid for by the tax payers, how it reduces duplication of efforts, or prevents vendor lock in. But none of that matters if the workflow on the other side of the (fire)wall is predicated on a culture of distrust. We need to make the plea further up the value chain.

We should focus our efforts on the 99% that happens before the code makes it out the door. [Open source was never intended to be a verb](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/15/open-source-is-not-a-verb/). In fact, open source has little to do with code being public. Hitting a publish button does nothing to change a toxic culture that technology has long since deprecated. 

We should be opening the eyes of public servants. Let them realize that their workflow may as well involve a typewriter and a fax machine (if it doesn't already). To inspire people on the inside - the people coding the software, collecting the data, and writing the policies - that there are much, much easier ways to do things, and then to [show them how](http://ben.balter.com/open-sourcing-government/).

Whether public or within an organization, at its core, open source is about open collaboration. It's about realizing that creating stuff is a team sport. That it's not a zero sum game. That erecting technical and administrative constraints to hinder the free flow of information simply serves to introduce friction and decrease the overall efficiency of the system. That for every dollar spent locking things down or defining rigid procedures, you also spend a dollar shooting yourself in the foot.

Instead, we should work to remedy the culture of distrust. To introduce a no fault mentality. To acknowledge were all on the same team. To begin to build communities around shared challenges. We need to focus on making the entire process [open from the start](http://ben.balter.com/2012/06/26/why-you-should-always-write-software-as-open-source/), even if the code never leaves the firewall.
