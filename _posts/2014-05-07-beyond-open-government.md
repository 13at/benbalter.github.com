Open government is great. At least, it was in the 90s. FOIA requests, open data, seeing how your government works — it's arguably brought light to a lot of not-so-great practices, and in many cases, has spurred innovation and applications not otherwise imagined before the information's release.

It used to be that sharing information was really, really hard. Throughout the history of communication tools, the barrier to communicate — be it the printing press, fax machine, or floppy disks — have done three things: Lowered the cost to transmit information, increased who that information could be made available to, and increase how quickly that information could be distributed.

But printing presses and fax machines are largely one way and asynchronous. They let you more easily request and eventually see how the sausage *was* made, but don't let you actually take part in the sausage making. You may be able to see what's wrong, but you don't have the chance to make it better. By the time you find out, it's already too late.

As technology allows us to communicate with greater frequency and greater fidelity, we have the chance to make our government not only transparent, but collaborative.

## The open source workflow

Open source software — software for which the underlying source code is not only made available to the public, but to which users of the software are encouraged to submit bugs and proposed improvements — started out the same way. It started out as simply open source. Everyone had access to the code, but it was published in one-way mediums — by mail, via FTP, or via read-only websites. Since then it's moved to a distributed workflow. One that exposes process, lives and dies by the URL, and allows anyone in the world to submit proposed improvements with our without the author's consent.

The original workflow may sound familiar. If I had a question about a particular piece of software, I'd email the author. If a piece of software had a bug, I'd email the author. If I had a proposed fix, you guessed it, I'd email the author.

This workflow isn't too disimilar from citizens calling their local congressperson's office with a constituent services request, or lobbyist scheduling a meeting with a congressmen to advocate for a particular issue as they do today. Whether software code or legal code, when you don't have the ability submit a proposed change upstream yourself, you're forced to go directly to the publisher.

## Beyond hub and spoke

But there are two problems with this hub-and-spoke model of bespoke collaboration. First, those one-off conversations generally happen in private. No URL, no change history, no way to trace back the eventual outcome to the original impetus. In open source, this means you don't always know a code's pedigree or intent. Who knows this code and who should I ask abou this bug?

In government, the samescenario is stereotypical more nefarious, with quintessential smoke-filled back rooms and briefcases is money. Who authored this law? What was their interest?

Second, when conversations are transacted via email (or notice and comment) or other one-to-one, highly asycronous means, there's an opportunity for vertical communication (me and my government), but no opportunity for horizontal communication (me and my fellow citizens), at least not officially.

In the software world, this often means that multiple users experiencing the same bug ask the same question or file the same bug report multiple times, not to mention, absent a system of self help, it creates a bottleneck in the project maintainer. There's no opportunity for a fellow user to say "I had the problem last week, here's what I did", as we often see by Googling many common problems.

In government that's also true, with the added harm of hindering the marketplace of ideas. "Here's a bunch of ideas government, you figure them out" is a lot less effective at solving shared problems then a community reaching a rough consensus.

## Learning from open source

So what can government workflows learn from today's decentralized open source workflows? How do we encourage policy makers and bureaucrats to move from closed government to open government to collaborative government?

For one, we geeks can help to create a culture of transparency within government by driving up the demand side of the equation. Be vocal. Demand data. Build lightweight apps.

Second, it's a matter of tooling. We've got great tools out there — things like Git that can track who made what change when and open standards like CSV or JSON that don't require proprietary software — but by-and-large they're a foreign concept in government, at least among those empowered to make change. Comand line interfaces with black background and green text can be intimidating...

1. Culture of transparency, demand
2. Tools in the hands
3. Behave
