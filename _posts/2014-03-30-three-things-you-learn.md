Just over a year ago, I moved from the federal government, arguably [the most bureaucratic organization in the history of the world](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/03/22/sinkhole-of-bureaucracy/), to GitHub, arguably [the world's least bureaucratic](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3020181/open-company/inside-githubs-super-lean-management-strategy-and-how-it-drives-innovation). Looking back, there are three key organizational differences beyond the lack of TPS reports:

### Optimize for happiness

### Provide room to fail
