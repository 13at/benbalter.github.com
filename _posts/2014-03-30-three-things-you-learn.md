Just over a year ago, I moved from the federal government, arguably [the most bureaucratic organization in the history of the world](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/03/22/sinkhole-of-bureaucracy/), to GitHub, arguably one of [the world's least bureaucratic](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3020181/open-company/inside-githubs-super-lean-management-strategy-and-how-it-drives-innovation). Looking back, there were three key organizational differences beyond size and the lack of TPS reports:

### Trust your coworkers

Much of my job at GitHub involves explaining open source to government employees and (hopefully) inspiring them to adopt more collaborative software-development workflows. The hard part in bridging this anachronistic divide isn't teaching version control or dependency management. Instead, it's the many incongruencies between government and open source that derive from one fundamental rift: trust.

At GitHub, I trust my coworkers. I trust them to write good code, I trust them to write good tests, I trust them to review each others pull requests, and I trust that it's gone through our standard development workflow, it's production ready, and my employer does the same. On day one I could theoretically have committed bad code, but I didn't, and technical constraints weren't the thing stopping me. Cultural constraints (and the threat of breaching that trust) were. As [Airbnb's cofounder explained on Medium](https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4):

>  The stronger the culture, the less process a company needs. When the culture is strong, you can trust everyone to do the right thing. People can be independent and autonomous. They can be entrepreneurial. In organizations... where culture is weak, you need an abundance of heavy, precise rules and processes.

Without that culture, management within government starts from a point of distrust. If an employee can do something, no matter how against their interest, the organization must assumes they will, and must put in place draconian administrative and technical constraints to prevent it from happening, no matter the cost.

*Lesson one: where an organization has the choice between empowering employees to do their job and minimizing risk, large organizations err on the side of minimizing risk.*

### Optimize for happiness

GitHub's philosophy, both in terms of internal development and in terms of outward facing product is simple: optimize for (developer) happiness. If there's something *de minimus* that will make me better at my job, be it 20 minutes or 20 dollars, I'm encouraged to do it, and can do so without a three-fold paperwork burden. Just as happy cows make better milk, and in turn better cheese, happy developers build better software, and in turn, more satisfied users. Happiness is best achieved when you [push decisions to the edge](http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/12/an-open-letter-to-government-cios/#decentralized), put your faith in the crowd, avoid blockers, and automate wherever possible.

The concept of "happiness" is foreign to a government agency. Using that word in a room full of IT management elicits the same blank stare as you might expect terms like "Node" or "Map Reduce" would. Is that Rube Goldberg Machine of a change review and deployment process frustrating? Would access to a piece of (free) software make your job easier?

Chances are, the process required to change the process, or to get approval for the thing you need is more time consuming than just doing things the hard way, and management within government's CYA culture isn't necessarily there to serve as your advocate to navigate the bureaucracy and politics on your behalf. From a technology standpoint, you don't even have the opportunity to yak shave, even if you wanted to.

*Lesson two: where an organization has the choice between employee happiness and minimizing risk, large organizations err on the size of minimizing risk.*

### Provide room to fail

At GitHub from day one, I could do my job, but also had the chance to fail (and did). Failure doesn't mean proposing a bad idea but having it overturned by your manager or some other bureaucratic safety net. Failure means small-scale public-facing failure: a bad deploy, a dumb feature you now need to support, an over-budget event.



*Lesson three: where an organization has the choice between encouraging innovation and minimizing risk, large organizations err on the size of minimizing risk.*
