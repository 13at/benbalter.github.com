title: Twelve tips for growing communities around your open source project

The superficial promise of open source is that if you publish your code, others will make it better. Strictly speaking, that's not the case. To reap the benefits of open source, maintainers must seek to grow communities around their project, a step often overlooked when "publishing" code.

When it comes to growing communities, there's nothing unique about online communities. Online communities are offline communities, just online. Like your bowling league, place of worship, or neighborhood, there are members, leaders, and rules (be they written or unspoken).

Beyond establishing and enforcing such norms, maintainers seeking to grow communities need to attract members and encourage them to become leaders. My colleague @mikemcquaid describes this process as a [contributor funnel](https://speakerdeck.com/mikemcquaid/the-open-source-contributor-funnel). Similar to prospects traveling down a sales funnel, maintainers must market their project to attract users, provide opportunities for those users to contribute, and encourage repeat contributors to take on maintaining the project.

At GitHub, we've created [`opensource.guide`](https://opensource.guide) to memorialize some of those community-builing best practices, and have started prompting users to adopt them via [the community profile](https://github.com/blog/2380-new-community-tools). Beyond that, here are twelve tips for growing communities around your open source project:

### 1. Solve a shared problem

### 2. Choose an open source license

### 3. Link to the repository from wp.org

### 4. Publish technical documentation

### 5. Document how to contribute

### 6. Clarify support v. development

### 7. Welcome new contributors

### 8. Set up automated tests

### 9. Enforce WP code standards

### 10. Deploy to WordPress.org

### 11. Adopt a code of conduct

### 12. Find someone to adopt it
