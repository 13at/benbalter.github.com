After years of living at the bleeding edge of government IT, there's not been a single challenge presented that forces one to ask "is this even technically possible?". Sure, maybe the code hasn't been written yet, but you know that once it is, it will ultimately do that thing you want it to do â€” the technology's the easy part.

It's the culture we've go to worry about. Will the solution be adopted by the agency? Will existing habits subvert the cool thing you just made? Will the dream live on once you're at your next gig? If you ignore culture, even the most elegant of technological solutions can end up condemned to a dusty shelf as nothing more than the right solution to the wrong problem.

## This is why we can't have nice things

Great technologies already exist. Lots of them in fact. Yet public servants still insist on adopting and subsequently entrenching their inferior predecessors. There's a reason that heavyweight, proprietary systems are a sad running joke in the Beltway.[^1] The problem isn't developing newer, better, flashier tools or tools that are more open or more intellectually elegant. The problem is creating the culture and the ecosystem necessary to begin appreciating and sustaining the ones we've already got, you know, the ones we're already not using.

We're geeks. We're good at building things. Heck, it's fun, and it's what we do best. But it's time to realize that we're merely playing whack-a-mole. We keep building increasingly larger mallets thinking that if it were just *that much easier* to knock the mole back down, maybe it will finally stay there. Spoiler alert: it never will.

## Dat Elegant solution

There was a [recent exchange on the Twitters](https://twitter.com/dan_munz/status/351065902642503681) with some members of the open government community whom I respect greatly about [a recent proposal](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/readme.md), but I'm afraid it misses the point. The need for a distributed version control system to handle real time and large-scale government data would be a great problem to have. It'd be great because it'd mean that the supply side was there. Unfortunately, it's not, at least not yet, and no amount of [OT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) can overcome the challenges we current face:

I watch day in and day out as many of my former colleagues fight tooth-and-nail trying to convince well-meaning government bureaucrats to toss a scrap of government data over the firewall. It's a tiring process. After all, whack-a-mole is, by definition, a loosing game. But the answer's not Yet Another Mallet, nor is it to give up and build our own mole management solution. We should be making it dumb-simple to do the right thing. We should be building really, really boring stuff. The more boring the better. In many cases, we probably shouldn't be building anything at all. This is one of them.

## The culture is criminal

The problem isn't that government agencies want to share vast swaths of public data, or that they want to share it with increasing frequency, or to the point, that they lack the tools to do so properly. In fact, it's the exact opposite. It's that sharing data is seen as being too onerous. It's too taxing. It diverts funding from mission. It's a political liability. It goes against the organizational culture. And frankly, [we're not helping](http://ben.balter.com/2013/05/14/we-ve-been-selling-open-source-wrong/).

We should be making it so ridiculously straightforward for government agencies to distribute information and build collaborative communities around shared problems that it would be criminal for them not to. To break the bad habits. To get rid of the excuses. To educate. To inform. To inspire.

## Baby steps

Complex, bleeding edge tools aren't the solution to making government more open. Even our [flagship efforts](http://healtcare.gov) expose that well-established tools are lightyears ahead of the anachronism that is DC and simply baffle those the government turns to to implement them.[^2] Instead, it's about baby steps. It's about starting with a small real-world proof of concept at each agency, heck, maybe even each bureau, and gradually showing those may not even realize it, that they're empowered to fundamentally reimagine the relationship between citizens and government.

Let's get agencies to begin committing CSVs and geoJSON to GitHub, rather than merely uploading them to a unidirectional data portal or condemning the data to some proprietary format. Let's help make the entire data pipeline open from the start. Lets demonstrate the value proposition inherent in the open source community. To train government employees to begin to treat data like the rest of us treat code. To make them want to open up the data because there's a demonstrated community ready and waiting to nurture it.

We're going to need a smarter way to process real-time and large-scale government data eventually. There's no doubt in my mind. But we're not their yet. And we're not going to be any time soon, unless we can shift the balance of power. The technology's the easy part. When we need it, there's not doubt we can build it. The question is whether, we'll be building it along side an enthusiastic body of government technologists, or if it'll be the most technologically advance wack-a-mole mallet we've built to date.
