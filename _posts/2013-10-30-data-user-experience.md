There was [an interesting Hackernews comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6385623) that caught my eye around the recent release of a Bureau of Labor and Statistics API. User nmcfarl wrote:

This struck me for two reasons. First, it shows that the data publishers still believe that key stakeholders within government, do not yet understand the concept of or value in producing an API, a chilling thought considering the critical role open government data can, should, and is playing in shaping our economy.

Second, the fact that the documentation is geared not towards developers, but towards internal stakeholders shows a lack of consideration for the data consumer's user experience. Here, listing ID's is just scratching the surface. Is the API responsive? Does it return data in a usable format? Are related queries properly linked? The list goes on.

All experience, and especially government experience should be optimized for the consumer, not for the publisher, regardless of internal politics.
