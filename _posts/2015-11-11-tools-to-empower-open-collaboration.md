title: The four characteristics of modern collaboration tools
excerpt:
---

At GitHub, we have a unique way of working. Some might say it's the future of knowledge work, others might say that we picked up a pair of bolt cutters and now [everything looks like the lock on Wolf Blitzer's boat house](https://xkcd.com/801/). In reality, it's probably somewhere in between.

[We use GitHub to build GitHub](http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/). While that's obviously true for developers, and for writing the software that powers GitHub.com, it's less obviously true that we also use GitHub issues and pull requests to manage all sorts of non-code things from internal policies to legal to HR to Sales. Need a contract reviewed? Open an issue. Want to propose a change to our vacation policy? Submit a pull request. After all, [how you work is just as important as what you work on](http://ben.balter.com/2015/09/21/open-source-behind-the-firewall/#how-you-work-is-as-important-as-what-you-work-on), so why not use the best, most modern tools available.

Internally, this practice is often described as "everything should be on GitHub", but that's not exactly true. Modern, developer-centric workflows use all sort of non-GitHub tools to share information. We use Slack for real-time chat. We have an internal blog called "Team" for company-wide postings. Heck, every once in a while, we even, *gasp*, meet in person.

In practice GitHub has become a one-size-fits-all hammer for any [tangentially development related process](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/06/micro-purchase-lessons/), in reality, there are lots of great, purpose-built tools that can be used to achieve the same ends. Sales teams have Salesforce. HR Teams have things like Zenefits.

When people say "put it on GitHub", I suspect what they really getting after, is to put it on an open-source-inspired platform. GitHub is one of many tools that [take established open-source norms, and make them mainstream](http://ben.balter.com/2013/02/06/the-next-big-thing-is-already-here/). It's shorthand for using a modern collaboration tool that doesn't simply implement workflows that have existed since the advent of the typewriter.

A few years back @rtomayko described [the four constraints of open source](http://2ndscale.com/rtomayko/2012/adopt-an-open-source-process-constraints), and why you should adopt them for your own team, open, closed, software or otherwise. Building on that asumption, I'd like to propose that modern, open-source-inspired collaboration tools today, all have four common characteristics:

### 1. Shared

Open as widely as possible given the subject matter
Openness means openness for both humans and robots. Machine readability is key.

### 2. Captures Process

Discussion, decisions, and artifacts are naturally memorialized as they are created
Can happen technically (e.g., chat) or culturally (e.g., post notes after meeting)

### 3. Linkable

Concepts are can be linked to one another to provide greater context to readers
Concepts have unique URLs allowing that context to be shared atomically
Forcing ideas to have URLs make them agnostic of both time and place (no more "you had to be there")

### 4. Asynchronous decision making

In-person meetings are crutch for forcing organizational action
Work synchronously for conversations that require higher-fidelity mediums (e.g, squishy human stuff, brainstorming)
Work asynchronously for technical discussions, decision making, etc.

### Evaluating existing Tools

| Tool         | Shared | Captures Process | Linkable | Async |
|:-------------|:-------|:-----------------|:---------|:------|
| GitHub       |        |                  |          |       |
| Google Docs  |        |                  |          |       |
| Video chat   |        |                  |          |       |
| Sharepoint   |        |                  |          |       |
| Box/DropBox  |        |                  |          |       |
| IRL Meetings |        |                  |          |       |
