If there's one thing that defines the shift from another technology role to Product Management, it's the shift from thinking in terms of solutions to thinking in terms of problems.

As Engineers (or just about any other technical profession), we're trained to think in terms of solutions (what feature to build, how to build it, subsequent improvements, etc.), but given a sufficiently defined problem, the solution is the easy part (even if the implementation itself may be complex). The challenge lies in understanding customers' true needs (not just the stated ones), defining and prioritizing user problems, and evaluating potential solutions.

Ultimately, customers [hire products to do a job](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done). Imagine a customer comes to you asking for a 1/4" drill (a solution). Their stated problem may be the need for a 1/4" hole, but what they're really after is the ability to hang a picture (which could be accomplished a number of ways - a hammer and nail, Command strips, etc.). Going further, the underlying customer problem is the desire to remember milestones or important people in their life, which may be best served by an app on their phone or a digital picture frame altogether.

Are holes in the wall a concern? The need to also purchase a hammer and nail? Potentially hitting their finger as they hang it? The photo being hung crooked? Positioning on the wall? The ability to move the picture without damage? Which do they value more? How often do they hang pictures? How many photos are they hanging?

As a Product Manager, even when customers come to you with desired solutions (or you have one in mind), it pays to start by explicitly enumerating problems you're trying to solve (and the customers you're trying to solve them for). You'd be surprised how many different ways the same problem(s) can be solved or how the right solution can solve multiple problems for the customer.

### Why over What

The other way to think about talking in terms of problems instead of solutions is that you should spend more time talking about the "why", than you spend talking about the "what", or at least translating between the two.

If your team's goal is to do X, it's natural that you'll spend more time discussing and tracking what you need to do to get to X, than what X does. While managing work may be part of your role, it's important that the language you use frame things through a lens of end-user value.

If you spend months refactoring an app to make it "right" or to utilize a new technology, it's easy to talk about all the work you're doing, but if at the end, the only user-facing change is a small bug fix, it's hard to describe the "why", other than "this is better". On the flip-side, if a one- or two-line change can have immense user impact, it's boring to talk about the "what", but you could talk for hours about the "why".

As a Product Manager, your job is to optimize for those (ideally boring) low effort, high impact initiatives, and the easiest way is to do that is to focus on the "why", counterbalanced by the effort required, not the other way around.

### When in doubt, talk to customers

One of the most reliable tools in a Product Managers' toolbox is qualitative and quantitative user research. Looking at real-world product usage, running experiments, conducting interviews, and feedback through formal channels are invaluable sources of insight and inspiration.

Shortly after joining GitHub, I was introduced to the concept of the [Cluetrain manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/) (named for the fact that for many marketers, the clue train stopped there every day, but they never took delivery). In short, it says that "Markets are conversations". Companies can shout as loudly as they'd like about how great their product is, but customers will always have a louder, more trustworthy voice. Rather than creating artificial walls between those that build a product and those that use it, companies (and their employees) should participate in the communities that naturally form around them, and seek to facilitate natural, open, honest dialog among humans. Instead of press releases clearly created by committee, think Twitter replies, Hacker News comments, or replying directly to support requests. As a Product Manager, your job is to be part of that conversation.
