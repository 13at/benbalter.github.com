### Just a heads up

**How it works:** Create a pull request and immediately merge it yourself without others' review.

**When to use it:** When you're making a change so uncontroversial or strait forward that no review is required, but you want to let your teammates know that you've made the change. Dependency bumps are a good use case.

### Work in progress (WIP)

**How it works:** Prefix the pull request title with "WIP:". Optionally add :warning: emoji and "DO NOT MERGE" in bold if you're ultra-paranoid.

**When to use it:** When you've started a new feature, document, or bug fix, that's not quite ready for others to review, but you want to let your teammates know that you're working on the feature. This can be used to prevent the duplication of effort, save work that you've started, or complement your team's workflow.

### Early feedback

**How it works:** Roughly spike out a feature by creating a proof of concept or rough outline that expressed your idea in its final form.

**When to use it:** When you want feedback on your general approach or the idea itself. Is this a dumb idea? Is there a better way to do this? The content of the pull request exists to convey the idea, and will likely not be the final implementation. This may start as a WIP and may end with a line-by-line review.

### Line-by-line review

**How it works:** Submit a feature-complete pull request and cc relevant teams, asking for their review. Team memebers will comment line-by-line and re-review as you implement their changes.

**When to use it:** When you're ready to :ship: the thing. It may have been started as a work in progress, or for early feedback, but you've made it clear that unless you hear otherwise, you're going to hit merge.
