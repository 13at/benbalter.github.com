### If you see something, say something

They say in software development, that [the hardest part is finding the problem, not solving it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law). At GitHub we have a strong tradition of "staff shipping" features for a day, a week, even a few months to get a better sense of how the feature performs within the context of a user's workflow, not to mention, [we use the product day in and day out](http://ben.balter.com/2016/08/22/ten-ways-to-make-a-product-great/#drink-your-own-champagne), so that we can be among the first to notice when something's awry. Whether it's a staff-only feature, or a feature that's been baked into the product for years, we'd much rather a fellow GitHubber find (and report) the problem, rather than subjecting a user to the suboptimal experience. [Issues are cheap](http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/#nobody-gets-fired-for-delbuying-ibmdel-opening-an-issue) and are easily closed if not in order. But you can take that idea a step further: [Borrowing a page from the Boy Scouts handbook](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule), when implementing a new feature, always leave the code better than you found it, regardless of who originally made the mess.

### Always be willing to help

One of the things I first noticed when I joined GitHub was that your fellow Hubbers were always willing to help. We use chat for just about anything, 

### Curiosity // Self improvement

### Professional but not formal

### Honesty, integrity, authenticity

### Appreciation economy

### Ship early, ship often
