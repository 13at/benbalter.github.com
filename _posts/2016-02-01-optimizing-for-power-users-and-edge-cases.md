title: Optimizing for power users and edge cases is the easy part

When designing a product, be it an open source project, or a for-profit service, it's all too easy to optimize for power users and edge cases. While [the squeaky wheel may get the grease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_squeaky_wheel_gets_the_grease), that doesn't mean that it should. The real challenge for any product lies in nailing the out-of-the-box experience for 80% of users needs.

We're geeks. It's always going to be more fun to develop the new wiz-bang feature that will allow the app to work with whatever's currently on the top of Hacker News, or to design a method that elegantly accounts for when your program is used at the South Poll by a user running Window XP SP1 under a full moon. Those are fun engineering challenges for those of us that build software, but do little to benefit the majority of people that actually use it. Not to mention, it feels *really* good to close an issue as resolved.

Instead, feature requests should be evaluated through the lens of "what would benefit 80% of users?". No product is going to satisfy 100% of user needs.
