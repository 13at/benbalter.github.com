Open source has become somewhat of a Yelp for software, and with it, has the potential to shift the balance of power from software publishers to software consumers.

### The allegory of the lost carry out order

A few weeks ago, I was in a restaurant when they lost a guest's carry-out order. As the customer stormed away hungry, the host turned to me and remarked, "*that sucks, now he's going to leave a bad Yelp review.*" This interaction struck me as odd. The host didn't seem too concerned about upsetting the customer, but was instead deeply worried about what the internet might think.

In *ye olde* days before Yelp, restaurants basically had city food inspectors' opinion to care about. Sure, some of the fancier restaurants might get a visit from a food critic, but the long tail of restaurants did not, and even if they did, after the initial review, there's a long window where the risk of a return visit from a food critic is highly unlikely. Not to mention, while high-end restaurants downtown face steep competition, I suspect your neighborhood Italian or Chinese place does not feel the same pressure. As a result, restaurants were incentivized to care about the tangible. *Is the kitchen clean? Is the menu diverse enough? Are the prices right for the market?*

Yelp shifted that equation, by creating an incentive for restaurants to focus on the intangible (and beyond the bare minimum). All of a sudden it became *was the hostess welcoming enough to that guest? Is our staff properly trained? Can our kitchen get food out quickly?* In a pre-Yelp world, individuals' poor experiences weren't enough to motivate action in many markets, especially those with few repeat customers. One customer might be able to influence two, maybe three people, at most. If they're an extremely vocal connector, maybe ten potential customers? In a post-Yelp world, that same, single scorned customer can cause someone they've never met to continue walking right to the place next door instead. In this sense, crowdsourced-reviews shift the balance of power from service provider to service consumer, creating an incentive for more than mere box checking. The shift in power applies equally to both soft tacos and software.

### The internet empowers consumers

Whether a restaurant, a software project, or an open data effort, public, consumer-moderated discussion forums do three things:

1. **Amplify single voices** - Traditionally, there's been a power imbalance, when it comes to the ability to communicate with customers. The restaurant has a monopoly, as by definition, all customers must go to them to get the service. Customers traditionally had no means of reaching other customers *en mass*, short of picketing outside. Online forums change that, making a single voice as loud as, and in many cases, louder than the service provider. Readers know that the service provider has an incentive to paint themselves in the best light. The reviewer has no such incentive to demonize the service, and thus readers take that peer perspective into account when weighing the veracity of conflicting claims.

2. **Make private knowledge public** - Restaurants have enjoyed a similar monopoly when it comes to information. By definition, they know everything about themselves. *Is the bread fresh or frozen? Does the soup come from a can? Is the pasta cooked in chicken broth? Is the signature dish over priced?* This type of insider information often comes from being a regular. Today, online forums create somewhat of a hive-mind consumer, allowing otherwise private knowledge to become public, and empowering each consumer to be a first-time regular.

3. **Connect seemingly isolated experiences** - Service providers similarly enjoy an advantaged perspective. By virtue of being the service provider, they see and interact with each customer. Customers, by and large only see themselves, and maybe those in their immediate proximity. It's easy to write off a sub-par waiter as having an off night, or being an isolated experience, but online forums let consumers share those poor experience, exposing patterns and trends. Where a consumer might see a single bad waiter, the crowd cam see chronic poor service and pattern inadequate training.

### Waiter, there's a bug in my software

What if all software had public review forums like most restaurants do today? This is true of just about all open source software, and the same consumer-empowering trends could hold true of closed-sourec software as well. There's no reason a software project's repository on GitHub needs to contain the software's source code. Even if it served as a consumer-moderated discussion forum, it'd have several implications for the software:

* **Perception** -
* **Customer experience** -
* **Quality** -
* **Follow up**

### Government's transparency imperative

Even if you find flaws in the argument that all software, both open and closed, should have public discussion forums, one class of software, government software, could benefit disproportionately from being more transparent.

Unlike say, Coke or Pepsi, government organizations have an obligation to be transparent. For one, the software is taxpayer-funded, and thus taxpayers have a right to the software they paid for, and to have a say in its direction. Additionally, as software and algorithms are increasingly relied on by government to regulate industries and deliver citizens services, software transparency becomes a means for citizens to check the government's work.

Today, I suspect that a significant percentage of government software, isn't closed source for security reasons, but rather because closed source is a cushy default, and at this point, it's easy to sweep  imperfect code (because all code is imperfect) under the rug, rather than be potentially embarrased by potentially accurate, but critical feedback.

### Why do government agencies get off easier than Taco Bell?
