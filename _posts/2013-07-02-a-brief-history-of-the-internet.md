One camp, generally constituting more "enterprise" users, needs super serious tools for super serious business. If the new file format can't scale to a million records on day one, well then, it's not a format. The other camp, the hackers, are the little guys. They prefer to start small. To take existing, proven methods, things that are already baked into the patchwork that is the Internet, and co-opt them for this new cause.

We saw this first when every new service would pick its own port and protocol, rather than using HTTP (which we eventually realized was the sane way to go), with XML giving way to JSON as the Internet's lingua franca, with SOAP's craziness yielding to REST's simplicity. The list goes on. Complex, heavyweight approaches that may look great on paper make gain traction early on as proprietary or custom-built solution, but eventually a simpler standard, one that
