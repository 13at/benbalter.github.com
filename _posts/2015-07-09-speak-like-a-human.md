title: "Speak like a human"
excerpt: ""

If there's one thing that corporations are consistently good at, it's talking like a corporation. We've all seen it. You read a blog post about an "innovative, new" this or a "first-of-its-kind" that. Your eyes instantly glaze over and although you eyes may still be moving, you stop reading. You know they're not talking to you, but at you. It doesn't have to be that way. Corporations are fully capable of talking like humans do, and unsurprisingly their customers respond positively when they do.

If you've ever read [the GitHub Blog](https://github.com/blog), you'll notice that at GitHub, we pride ourselves in "being human". Not "being authentic" or "speaking like a human", but actually being human. There may be a corporate logo at the top of the page, but blog posts are still exclusively written by, and read by humans.

Think of the typical corporate ship post. It probably starts something like this:

> Today, after months of effort, we're excited to announce our new wiz-bang feature.

Here's the thing. Your users don't care how excited you are. They don't care about how much effort you put in. All they care about is one thing: how does it benefit me?

Here are _____ simple rules

### 1. Focus on one thing

A blog post gives an idea a URL. 

### 2. The title should summarize the entire post

### 3. The first sentence should summarize the entire post


### 2. Remove ~~unneccessary~~ words

### 3. Write for users, not for yourself

### 4. An animated GIF is worth 10,000 words

### 5. Don't lede with "today"
