title: "Speak like a human: N rules for writing less-corporate blog posts"
excerpt: ""
---

If there's one thing that corporations are consistently good at, it's talking like a corporation. We've all seen it. You read a blog post about an "innovative, new" this or a "first-of-its-kind" that. Your eyes instantly glaze over and although you eyes may still be moving, you've stopped reading. You know marketing speak when you see it. They're not talking to you, but at you.

Thankfully, it doesn't have to be that way. Corporations are fully capable of talking like humans do, at least the humans that make up that company are, and unsurprisingly their customers respond positively when they're treated with respect.

If you've ever read [the GitHub Blog](https://github.com/blog), you'll notice that at GitHub, we pride ourselves in "being human". Not "being authentic" or "speaking like a human", but actually being a gosh-darn human. There may be a corporate logo at the top of the page, but blog posts are still exclusively written by, and read by humans. So let's write *for* them.

Think of the typical corporate ship post. It probably starts something like this:

> Today, after months of effort, we're excited to announce our new wiz-bang feature.

Here's the thing. Your users don't care how excited you are. They don't care about how much effort you put in. All they care about is one thing: how does it benefit me?

Here are _____ simple rules

### 1. Focus on one thing

A blog post gives an idea a URL. It's the thing I can link to in perpetuity to explain to others what action you took and why. When you start sneaking multiple ideas into a single post, or go off on a mini-treatise about the virtue of producing widgets, you've broken that one-to-one relationship. Keep posts limited to one single idea, the smallest, most granular idea possible. If something can be split into two or more posts, you almost always should.

If during development you feel two concepts need explained in order to introduce a feature, ship what you have now before going any further.

### 2. The title should summarize the entire post

In the typical corporate blog, the signal-to-noise ration is usually pretty low, at least in terms of things I care about. Even if it's all ship posts, there's a good chance I have no use for the new feature. No matter how good your creative team is at coming up with clever or link-bait style post titles, the title should summarize the entire post for the reader. The idea is to forcast what the post is about and give them an early escape hatch to bail if they don't want to read it. The post is for the reader's benefit (see below), and assume you don't have ads on your site, you've got nothing to gain by tricking them into clicking your link.

### 3. The first sentence should be the one thing you want the reader to know

The first sentence of the post should, when combined with the title, further summarize the post. This should be the one thing that if they stopped reading right now, that you'd hope they take away. Think grammar school style reverse pyramid. Put the most important things up front and go from there.

Readers have an extremely short attention span and even less time to spend reading something they don't care about. Imagine a power curve with 80% of readers reading the first sentence, and the probably of a reader continuing dropping off sentance-by-sentance from there. You should assume that readers will take less than 30 seconds to read your entire post, and less than three seconds to decide if they're even going to get that far. Write accordingly.

### 2. Remove ~~unneccessary~~ words

If you can remove a word, phrase, sentence or paragraph without the post losing its meaning, it needs to go. Facts > fluff.

### 3. Write for users, not for yourself

I'm sure what you do is super interesting. But what's even more interesting is what I can do now as a result of your work. Instead of telling me how excited you are or how much work it was for you to implement, tell me why your work matters to someone using your product. A simple rule of thumb is that there should be more use of the word "you" than of "we". An even better rule of thumb is to avoid using the word "we" in the first place.

### 4. An animated GIF is worth 10,000 words

The best blog posts are short on words and long on visuals. You could spend 1,000 words describing what the new button looks like, or you can just show me a picture of it. Better yet, create an animated GIF of what happens when I click it.[^gifs] Have fun with it. At GitHub, we often hide easter eggs in screenshots. Think unreleased features or a scene from your favorite movie.

### 5. Don't use the word today

It's easy to begin a blog post "Starting today...". The thing that separates blog posts from just about any other content on the web is the fact that they have a date and serve as a snapshot in time. If you write something in a blog post, I'm going to go ahead and assume it's something timely. When launching something new, the word "today" often takes the place of more valuable information, like how to actually use the darn thing. When you leave out "today", you're forced to actually describe what's changed.

### 6. Embrace structure

It's a well known fact that people on the internet do not read words. They may read a sentence or two, but given a few hundred words, they're all but guaranteed to be skimming. Optimize the post's structure for readability. Use lots of descriptive headings, keep paragraphs short, and rely on large images to break up text when necessary.

### 7. Describe the 1/2" hole

Let's say I have a picture I want hung on the wall. I'll likely go to a big box retailer a pick up a 1/2" drill. But in reality, I could care less about the drill. What I'm really after is the 1/2" hole, the thing the drill enables me to do. Most technology companies produce drills. Rather than spend time telling me how great your drill is, describe the holes it produces. Show me how well it hangs pictures. Convince me that I want to hang pictures. In reality, consumers buy 1/2" holes, not 1/2" drills.


1/2 inch hole.

Always provide an out

[^gifs]: You can record screencasts using the version of Quicktime that comes with your Mac, and then use GIF Brewery, available in the app store, to convert the movie to an animated GIF. It takes less than five minutes, I promise.
