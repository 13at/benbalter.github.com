title: "Speak like a human: 11 ways tech. companies can write less-corporate blog posts"
excerpt: "Blog posts are a grea"
---

If there's one thing that corporations are consistently good at, it's talking like a corporation. We've all seen it. You're reading a blog post about an "innovative, new" this or a "first-of-its-kind" that. Before you realize it, although your now-glazed-over eyes may still be moving over the words, you've stopped reading entirely. You know marketing speak when you see it. They're not talking to you. They're talking at you.

Thankfully, it doesn't have to be that way. Corporations are fully capable of talking like humans do, at least the humans that make up that company are, and unsurprisingly customers respond positively when treated with this kind of respect.

If you've ever read [the GitHub Blog](https://github.com/blog), you'll notice that at GitHub, we pride ourselves in "being human". Not "being authentic" or "speaking like a human", but actually being a gosh-darn human. There may be a corporate logo at the top of the page, but blog posts are still exclusively written by, and read by living, breathing humans (as far as we know).

[Markets are conversations](http://newclues.cluetrain.com). The most effective way to convey product information is to be part of that ongoing conversation, not to stand on top of a hill shouting mindless marketing speak. Put another way, if you wouldn't do it in real life - say when bumping into a customer at a coffee shop â€” why is it okay to do on your corporate blog?

Think of the typical corporate ship post. It probably starts something like this:

> Today, after months of effort, we're excited to announce our new wiz-bang feature.

Here's the thing: Your users don't care how excited you are. They don't care about how much effort you put in. All they care about is one thing: how does it benefit me?

Here are 11 simple rules

### 1. It's not shipped until you blog about it

If you start from the premise that markets are conversations, then the best person to talk about a new feature on behalf of your company is the person who shipped it, not someone from your marketing department. They know what the feature does, why you built it, and what users need to know in order to use it. Developers can talk about the technical details of the implementation, without things being dumbed down in translation, and designers can give a peak into their creative process with rich visuals, all things your users are interested in much more than any pretty-sounding marketing fluff a copywriter could possibly dream up.

There's also something to be said for giving the person that shipped the new feature the opportunity to take a public curtain call. Developers should author posts themselves (with help copyediting, if needed), and the post should be in their name. Anonymous posts are a great way to signal to users that that the organization is talking at them, rather than a human talking to them.

### 2. Write for users, not for yourself

I'm sure what you do is super interesting. But what's even more interesting is what I can do now as a result of your work. Instead of telling me how excited you are or how much work it was for you to implement the new thing (written from your perspective), tell me why your work matters to someone using your product (written from the user's perspective). A simple rule of thumb is that there should be more use of the word "you" than of "we". An even better rule of thumb is to avoid using the word "we" in the first place.

### 3. Describe the 1/4" hole

Your post should focus on what a user can do, not on what the thing you built does. Let's say I have a picture that I want hung on the wall. I'll likely go to a big box retailer to pick up a 1/4" drill. But in reality, I could care less about the drill. What I'm really after is the 1/4" hole, the thing the drill enables me to do. Most technology companies produce digital drills. Rather than spend time telling me how great your drill is, describe the holes it produces. Show me how well it hangs pictures. Plant the seed in my head for all the great things that I can do with the drill. Airline commercials have pictures of exotic destinations, not cabin interiors. Liquor commercials show people out having a great time, not grains being grown. When announcing a new feature your post should be almost exclusively about the better hole it empowers the user to create, not the new drill bit they now need to buy.

### 4. The title should summarize the entire post

In the typical corporate blog, the signal-to-noise ration is usually pretty low, at least in terms of things the user cares about. Even if a blog is exclusively used to announce new features, there's a good chance that I have no use for any given feature. No matter how good your creative team is at coming up with clever or link-bait style post titles, the title should summarize the entire post for the reader. The idea is to forecast what the post is about and give the user an early escape hatch to bail if they don't want to read it. The post is for the reader's benefit, and assuming you don't have ads on your site, you've got nothing to gain by tricking them into clicking your link. Let users opt in to reading your post, rather than coercing them though cleverness or slight of hand.

### 5. The first sentence should be the one thing you want the reader to know

The first sentence of the post should, when combined with the title, further summarize the post. This should be the one thing that if the user stopped reading right now, that you'd hope that they'd take away. Think grammar school style reverse pyramid. Put the most important things up front and go from there in decreasing order of importance.  With a few exceptions, your post should almost always describe what's new, how to use it, and why it matters, in that order.

Readers have an extremely short attention span and even less time to spend reading something they don't care about. Imagine a power curve with 80% of readers reading the first sentence, and the probably of a reader continuing dropping off sentance-by-sentance from there. You should assume that readers will take less than 30 seconds to read your entire post, and less than three seconds to decide if they're even going to get that far. Write accordingly.

### 6. An animated GIF is worth 10,000 words

The best blog posts are short on words and long on visuals. You could spend 1,000 words describing what the new button looks like, or you can just show me a picture of it. Better yet, create an animated GIF of what happens when I click it.[^gifs] Have fun with it. At GitHub, we often hide easter eggs in screenshots. Think unreleased features or a scene from your favorite movie. The abstract concepts often involved with new features are easier to describe visually and helps the reader to put themself in the shoes of the user.

### 7. Focus on one thing

A blog post gives an idea a URL. It's the thing that I can link to in perpetuity to explain to others what action you took and why. It's how I share with others that I'm excited about a new feature. When you start sneaking multiple ideas into a single post, or go off on a mini-treatise about the virtue of producing widgets, you've broken that one-to-one relationship. Keep posts limited to one single idea, the smallest, most granular idea possible. If something can be split into two or more posts, you almost always should. If you find yourself needing to explain two distinct concepts, ship what you've got before going any further.

### 8. Remove ~~unneccessary~~ words

If you can remove a word, phrase, sentence or paragraph without the post losing its core message, it needs to go. Facts > fluff.

### 9. Don't use the word "today"

It's easy to begin a blog post with "Starting today...". The thing that separates blog posts from just about any other content on the web is the fact that they have a date at the top, a date which allows them to serve as a snapshot in time. If you write something in a blog post, I'm going to go ahead and assume it's something timely. When launching something new, the word "today" often takes the place of more valuable information, like how to actually use the darn thing. When you leave out "today", you're forced to actually describe what's changed. Likewise, never tease your users with features that haven't yet shipped.

### 10. Embrace structure

It's a well known fact that people on the internet do not read words. They may read a sentence or two, but given a few hundred words, they're all but guaranteed to be skimming after the first sentance. Optimize the post's structure for ease of readability. Use lots of descriptive headings, keep paragraphs short, and rely on large images to break up text when necessary. Lists should always be bulleted, not comma separated, and links to resources should be peppered throughout.

### 11. Always provide an out

The user's read your post, you've gotten them excited, now what? What's the call to action? What's their ideal first click after reading? Provide it. It may be documenting describing in detail, how to use the new thing, or may be a link directly to the new thing itself. Either way, the idea here is to nudge the user in the desired direction.



[^gifs]: You can record screencasts using the version of Quicktime that comes with your Mac, and then use GIF Brewery, available in the app store, to convert the movie to an animated GIF. It takes less than five minutes, I promise.
