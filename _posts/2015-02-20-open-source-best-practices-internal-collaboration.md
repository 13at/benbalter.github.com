Excerpt: ""

### 1. Expand your definition of stakeholders

### 2. Be the hub, encourage spokes

* You are the host of the internet’s most boring cocktail party
* Non-blocking is  better than blocking
* Be a matchmaker (connect subject matter experts and technical experts in the open)
* Minimize one-to-one interactions  (emailing anonymous-inbox@agency.gov)
* Every answer to every question should have a URL  (and a human name and face)
* Answer questions once (or never if the community can)

### 3. Minimize Friction

* Friction (n) The time it takes to go from “I want to contribute” to “I have contributed”
* What does this thing do?
* What language is this thing written in?
* Do I need a lawyer to know if I can use it?
* How do I bootstrap my local development environment
* How do I submit an improvement? How long will it take to merge?

### 4. Decentralize governance

* You don’t need a meeting  to merge a pull request
* You don’t need a suit  to merge a pull request
* You need to be a member of the community to participate in it
* Responding to issues and providing support
* Code review and enforcing project style
* Accepting or rejecting pull request on behalf of the project Long-term planning, roadmaps, releases

### 5. Encourage contributors

* The right to contribute is assumed  in the open source world
* It’s not in government
* Let developers know  you want contributions
* Go out of your way to encourage them
* In advance  (Document how to contribute, technical requirements, how to run the project locally in the README)
* Daily  (Provide constructive and supportive feedback, express gratitude when merging or commenting)
* Going Forward  (Automate testing with continuous integration, minimize friction through shared tooling)
