I've written before about [the *how* of assigning URLs to concepts](http://ben.balter.com/2014/10/07/expose-process-through-urls/), but even more important is the *why*. URLs render context time and location agnostic.

You see, humans have a terrible fidelity for retaining historic context, deliberative process, and decision pedigree. As an organization works towards its mission — be it a three-person team or an entire company — discussions are held, decisions are made, and ideally, artifacts are created as a result. The problem is, most often, those decision artifacts focus on what decision was made, not who made it or why.

### Today's default workflow

Most organizations today transact business almost entirely through email and in-person meetings. Absent an additional step whereby participants go out of their way to capture and share context, organization knowledge primarily lives in two places: in employees' heads, and in their inbox. If that employee leaves the organization, or if they win the lottery and don't show up on Monday (read: [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)), a significant amount of information — information essential to the organization's smooth operation — goes out the door with them.

Think through some common scenarios where a team member might need to gain additional context they weren't originally privy to. They could have been out of the office when a decision was made (humans do silly things like getting sick or making other, smaller humans), they could have been on a different team at the time, heck, maybe they weren't even part of the organization back then. Whatever the reason, they became a stakeholder mid-decision or after a decision was made, and lack the context necessary to properly participate going forward.

How is that essential context shared? In many organizations I suspect the answer is *"I guess you had to be there. I think Bob was there that day, you should go ask him"*. Assuming you can find Bob's desk, he's in the office, free at the moment, and remembers a meeting that potentially happened months or years earlier, you might be able to get your question answered, but that process doesn't scale as people move around and new team members are onboard. Bob could hunt through his inbox and forward a stream of emails for you to read through in reverse chronological order, but that's likely neither efficient nor very helpful ("can you forward me the attachment?").

### Systems that naturally capture and expose process

Theoretically, you could have a dedicated cadre of scribe-stenographers to sit in on every meeting, email thread, and water cooler conversation, recording what was said and who said it, or you can create a an equally onerous culture whereby decisions are extensively memorialized after the fact by force of habit, but in an increasingly technology-centric world, it makes more sense to lean on computers to do the heavy lifting by adopting systems that naturally capture and expose process as you go.

Obviously certain types of conversations — interpersonal conflicts, brain storming sessions, and professional development to name a few — are much better suited for higher-fidelity mediums like in-person meetings, phone calls, and video conferences. But the vast majority of office communication, especially those related to decision making, can and should be shifted to more modern, asynchronous tools. Think Slack, GitHub issues, or Basecamp.

### URLs are how we share information today

Hundreds of years ago, the way humans shared information was through storytelling. Writing and the printing press shifted things towards written communication (passing around dead trees to share information), and the internet shifted us once again to the digital. Today, the primary means of sharing information with another human is through a URL. Maybe in 10 years we'll have virtual reality goggles and you'll describe directions to walk to a virtual location to get information, but for now, ideas have globally unique identifiers that begin with `http`. Want to share a New York Times article? Send them a URL. A product on Amazon? A funny Tweet? Every major system we use today creates unique URLs for each distinct idea.

Ask yourself this: Has your organizations workflow changed much since the Cold War? Since the advent of the internet? If you swapped out your laptop for a typewriter and email for inter-office couriers would the way you work be all that fundamentally different? From video conferencing to a distributed workforce to real-time chat the tools available to organizations has radically shifted. Shouldn't our workflows improve, at least a little?

### The value of giving concepts URLs

Regardless of the tool or technology used, when process is captured and exposed through URLs a few things happen:

1. URLs service as artifacts for what decisions was made, why it was made, and who made it. Also capture what other alternatives were considered and why they were rejected

2. Giving something a URL forces the moving party to distill their ideas down to written form, to capture the essential elements of their proposal and articulate it in the clearest way possible. "Reduce to writing" -> distill to what matters

3. Ability to link related concepts to prior art and ground discussions in the tangible

4. Provide opt-in context for tangential stakeholders

### URL does not mean public free-for-all

Having a URL is distinct from the scope in which something is shared. Can be URL'd to 1, 2, 100, or 6 Billion people

Can have a URL that exposes context that is read only (e.g. a chat transcript)
Can have a URL that exposes context to a select group, without exposing that context to the world, entire organization, etc.
Can have a URL that exposes context after the fact (e.g., imagine "open sourcing" an issue once it's closed)

What about sensitive conversations? When someone gets fired? Salary negotiations? Interpersonal conflicts? Legal disputes? In my mind those transaction should all have URLs. I shouldn't have access to the content if I were not otherwise involved, but if I were designing the ideal way for an organization to work, It'd be far preferable for there to be a digital record capturing who, how, and why each decision was made, available to those that were part of the decision, than for it to to only exist on paper, in the hallways, or in unspoken sentiment, which a flood, career change, or memory lapse can wipe out entirely (and isn't shareable, etc. as other members join the team).
