I've written before about [the *how* of assigning URLs to ideas](http://ben.balter.com/2014/10/07/expose-process-through-urls/), but even more important is the *why*: URLs render context time and location agnostic.

You see, humans have a terrible fidelity for retaining historic context, deliberative process, and decision pedigree. As an organization works towards its mission — be it a three-person team or an entire company — discussions are held, decisions are made, and ideally, artifacts are created as a result. The problem is, most often, those decision artifacts focus on what decisions were made, not who made them or why.

### Today's default workflow

Most organizations today transact business almost entirely through email and in-person meetings. Absent an additional step whereby participants go out of their way to capture and share context, organization knowledge primarily lives in two places: in employees' heads, and in their inbox. If that employee leaves the organization, or if they win the lottery and don't show up on Monday (read: [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)), a significant amount of information — information essential to the organization's continued operation — goes out the door with them.

Think through some common scenarios where a team member might need to gain additional context they weren't originally privy to: they could have been out of the office when a decision was made (humans do silly things like getting sick or making other, smaller humans), they could have been on a different team at the time, heck, maybe they weren't even part of the organization back then. Whatever the reason, they became a stakeholder mid-decision or after a decision was made, and lack the context necessary to properly participate going forward, especially not on equal footing.

How is that essential context shared? In many organizations I suspect the answer is *"I guess you had to be there. I think Bob was there that day, you should go ask him"*. Assuming you can find Bob's desk, he's in the office that day, free at the moment, and remembers a meeting that potentially happened months or years earlier, you might be able to get your question answered, but that process doesn't scale as people constantly move around and new team members are onboarded. Bob could hunt through his inbox and forward a stream of emails for you to read through in reverse chronological order, but that's likely neither efficient nor very helpful for either party involved ("can you forward me the attachment?").

### Systems that naturally capture and expose process

Theoretically, you could have a dedicated cadre of scribe-stenographers to sit in on every meeting, email thread, and water cooler conversation, recording what was said and who said it, or you can create a an equally onerous culture whereby decisions are extensively memorialized after the fact by force of habit, but in an increasingly technology-centric world, it makes more sense to lean on computers to do the heavy lifting by adopting systems that naturally capture and expose process as your organization conducts its business.

Obviously certain types of conversations — interpersonal conflicts, brain storming sessions, and professional development one-on-ones, to name a few — are much better suited for higher-fidelity mediums like in-person meetings, phone calls, and video conferences. But the vast majority of office communication, especially those related to decision making, can and should be shifted to more modern, asynchronous tools. Think Slack, GitHub issues, or Basecamp.

### URLs are how we share information today

Hundreds of years ago, the way humans shared information was through storytelling. Writing and the printing press shifted things towards written communication (passing around dead trees to share information), and the internet shifted us once again to the digital. Today, the primary means of sharing information with another human is through a URL. Maybe in 10 years we'll have virtual reality goggles and you'll describe directions to walk to a virtual location to get information, but for now, URLs are the primary means by which an ideas can be widely shared via a globally unique identifiers that begin with `http`. Want to share a New York Times article? Send them a URL. A product on Amazon? A funny Tweet? Whether you realize it or not, every major online system we use today creates unique URLs for each distinct idea.

Ask yourself this: Has your organizations workflow changed much since the Cold War? Since the advent of the internet? If you swapped out your laptop for a typewriter and email for inter-office couriers would the way you work be all that fundamentally different? From video conferencing to a distributed workforce to real-time chat, the tools available to organizations has radically shifted. Shouldn't our workflows improve as a result of that shift, at least a little?

### The value of giving concepts URLs

Regardless of the tool or technology employed, when process is captured and exposed through a URL a few things happen:

First, URLs serve as artifacts for what decision was made, why it was made, and who made it. It alleviates the need for "you had to be there" and "go ask Bob". It provides a single, uncontrovertible source of truth for the organization's intention, and equally important, exposes the reasoning behind the decision, reducing the tendency for business decisions to be communicated as "because I said so". In the military, this is the concept of [commander's intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)), and it provides organization members with the context to continue the mission despite evolving circumstances. Process artifacts also naturally capture what other alternatives were considered but ultimately rejected, preventing the organization from rehashing the same conversation six months (or six years) down the line. When organization members see not just what decision was made, but why, and the thought that went into all the alternatives considered, they're much more likely to buy in and contribute.

Second, giving process a URL forces the moving party to distill their ideas down into written form, to capture the essential elements of their proposal, and to articulate them in the clearest way possible. There's a reason it's called "reduceing something writing". It forces you to maximize the signal to noise ratio and focus on what matters. Once it written form, in addition to being more potent, those ideas suddenly become scalable. A meeting room can only fit so many people and an all hands can only accomidate so many times zones, but the effort required to articulate an idea in writing to one person is the same as the effort required to articulate that same idea to a million. URLs allow ideas to become viral.

Third, URLs provide organizations the unique ability to link related concepts, to reference prior art, and to ground discussions in the tangible. Once decisions have URLs, related decisions URLs can reference one another, creating an interconnected web of the organization's collective knowledge. Decisions rarely happen in a vacuum and the ability to reference prior (or dependent) decisions — with the full context immediately available to those who click the link — becomes immensely valuable to grounding discussions in the tangible. It's no longer "Alice would want us to do X", but "here's what Alice has already said on the topic", or "here are the latest numbers Alice ran last week". Especially when discussing technical matters, be they software, financial, legal, or administrative, being able to immediately bring images, charts, and other quantitative resources directly into the discussion grounds the discussion in facts, not opinions, and increases the velocity of decision making by reducing the blocking synchronicity of traditional access to organizational knowledge.

Finally, URLs allow stakeholders, whether directly or tangentially affected by a decision, to opt-in to an endless amount of organizational context. Imagine a typical policy decision. "We're now putting covers on our TPS reports". Traditionally this edict might be handed down in a PDF'd memo on company letter head (printed, signed, and scanned of course) to make it "official". Those affected get only the context provided by the memo itself, which because it requires an additional step to expose the process surrounding the decision, often includes only the final outcome and the means to cary it out, not why it was made or how. If instead, that decision were posted to an internal company blog, with a link to the forum in which that decisions was made, not only would that provide instantly more pedigree, but suddenly anyone affected, delighted or disgruntled, can freely opt-in to as much, or as little, additional context as they'd like, once again increasingly the liklihood of genuine buy in and organizational alignment.

### URL does not mean public free-for-all

Having a URL is distinct from the scope in which something is shared. Can be URL'd to 1, 2, 100, or 6 Billion people

Can have a URL that exposes context that is read only (e.g. a chat transcript)
Can have a URL that exposes context to a select group, without exposing that context to the world, entire organization, etc.
Can have a URL that exposes context after the fact (e.g., imagine "open sourcing" an issue once it's closed)

What about sensitive conversations? When someone gets fired? Salary negotiations? Interpersonal conflicts? Legal disputes? In my mind those transaction should all have URLs. I shouldn't have access to the content if I were not otherwise involved, but if I were designing the ideal way for an organization to work, It'd be far preferable for there to be a digital record capturing who, how, and why each decision was made, available to those that were part of the decision, than for it to to only exist on paper, in the hallways, or in unspoken sentiment, which a flood, career change, or memory lapse can wipe out entirely (and isn't shareable, etc. as other members join the team).
