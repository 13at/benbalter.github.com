title: What does your organization optimize for?
excerpt: "A quick glance at someone's laptop can tell you a lot about that person and their employer."

Every organization is optimized for exactly one thing. In the private sector, it's usually profit. In government, depending on the agency, it's often either predictability or fairness of process. At GitHub it's developer happiness. Whatever your organization is optimized for, employees will use that organizational goal as a guidepost to navigate ambiguity. All tasks can be seen through that lens. Take laptop stickers as an example:

A quick glance at someone's laptop can tell you a lot about their employer. It used to be that as one traveled, their luggage would accumulate [layer-upon-layer of labels](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wavesjax/), each telling the story of where they've been and what they've experienced. Today, that tradition lives on in the world of IT, as geeks decorate their laptop shells with stickers of the conferences they've attended and the technologies they've learned and grown to love. HTML5, jQuery, and WordPress stickers? Likely a front-end developer. Node, GitHub, and Ubuntu stickers? You've found yourself web developer. A well decorated laptop is often the Boy or Girl Scout merit badges of the startup community.

Even more telling, however, is the young developer with the naked laptop, a sight as common as Blackberrys are within government. Often, the indiscrete Thinkpad is adorned with a single, high-visibility, tamper resistant sticker, utilitarian barcode and "ASSET" in bold letters. Adding insult to injury, there's a strong chance that that label is going to be on the top of the laptop shell, and positioned a litteral 180 from the hacker community, oriented so that when the laptop's open, it's upside down.

Let's unpack that for a second. There's a few ways you can see that the experience is optimized for the person tracking the "asset" (process), not for the person who uses the laptop each day (happiness).

First, assuming the laptop's inventoried once or twice a year, placing the sticker on the bottom of the laptop, out of sight from day-to-day use, or at the very least, right side up when in use, does nothing to inhibit the employer's ability to track their investment.

Second, more times than not,

 . The experience should be optimized for the person who uses the laptop each day, not for the bureaucratic process that checks it in and out.

The fact that employees are often prohibited (or assume they are prohibited by organizational culture) from placing a sticker on their laptop is a great metaphor for giving technical talent the space and freedom they need to be creative.
