Working in DC, "hacker" can often be seen as a four-letter word. I can't count the number of timess a press aide or government attorney has cringed at seeing it in a press release, or even worse, as an event audaciously entitled a "hackaton". To the media and many government types hacking often conjures up images of malcontents in the dark of night  wearing a ski mask lit by the menacing glow of a computer screen, but to the rest of the world (and especially the internet), the term has a very, very different meaning. Heck, even Merriam-Webster defines hacker as:

  1. "One that hacks" ("to write computer programs for enjoyment"), 
  2. "a person who is inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity", and
  3. "an expert at programming and solving problems with a computer"

Being a hacker isn't about stealing credit card numbers or disabling public utilities, but rather it's the exact opposite. It's about embodying all three of those definitions simultaniously. It's about sharing, openness, decentralization… *coding to improve world*. It's about trying to satisfy an unquenchable thirst for defying expectations and making the impossible a reality, often involving ductape, bubblegum, and ultimately solutions that perported experts would certainly balk at for being too simplistic.

The term traces its routes all the way back to the 1960s when it emerged to describe a certain playful cleverness of exploration that surrounded those at MIT who openly pushed the limits of the world's first computers. Today it continues to embody that ethic as the persuit of excelence — constantly asking oneself "is this even possible?" It's the intrinsic delight one gets from solving never-before-solved problems and overcomming limits conventional wisdom long-ago presumed impossible.

## The Hacker Ethic

Hackers are motivated by an unwaivering ethic:[^1]

* **Sharing** - Hacking requires the ability to take things apart and figure out how they work in the hopes of ultimately improving upon them. It's a "hands on" imperative that necessitates both access to and the right to fork a project in hopes of building something even more interesting and ultimately expanding the technology available to all.
* **Openness** - Hacking is a group effort, and thus the free flow of information is a necessity for hackers to fix, improve, and reinvent. Secrecy simply serves to stifle creative possibility. Freedom of inquiry requires that information be free.
* **Decentralization** - The best way to promote the free exchange of information is to have an open system that provides no friction between a hacker and his or her quest for knowledge. By intentionally or unintentionally erecting such bariers, bureaucracies, whether corporate, government, or university, are inharently flawed systems.
* **Coding to improve the world**

## The Hacker Way

But it's more than that. There's a practical side. There's a constant intelectual itch just begging to be scratched:[^2]

* **The world is full of problems waiting to be solved** - In the hands of a creative mind, technology can make the world a better place for all. Just as athletes seek delight in pushing their bodies past their physical limits, hackers seek the thrill of pushing beyond what is known, what is solved, and what is possible.
* **No problem should ever have to be solved twice** - Creative minds are a valuable, finite resource and shouldn't be wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are fascinating, unsolved problems waiting.

## Hacker Culture

* **Meritocracy** - Hackers should be judged by their contribution to the community. 
* **Ellegance** - Hackers deeply appreciate innovative techniques which allow programs to perform complicated tasks with few instructions. A program's code was considered to hold a beauty of its own, having been carefully composed and artfully arranged
* **Playful cleverness** - taking the serious humorously and their humor seriously

## Hackers in the Enterprise

It's no surprise then, that as the pace of technological innovation quickens, the very beurocuracies that hackers condemn are begining to realize the true value of a hacker.
