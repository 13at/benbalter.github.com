Merriam-Webster defines hacker as:

  1. "One that hacks" ("to write computer programs for enjoyment"), 
  2. "a person who is inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity", and
  3. "an expert at programming and solving problems with a computer"

Hacking is about sharing, openness, decentralizationâ€¦ coding to improve world. Not just skunk works. https://twitter.com/BenBalter/status/212300151623135233

"just explain the problem to the hacker and let them find their own solution," http://www.intechnic.com/blog/a-hacker-the-secret-ingredient-your-it-department-lacks/

"[a] person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular."  RFC 1392

## The Hacker Subculture

a delight in solving problems and overcoming limits.

Hacker Ethic:

* Sharing - Access gives hackers the opportunity to take things apart, fix, or improve upon them and to learn and understand how they work. This gives them the knowledge to create new and even more interesting things and ultimately aids the expansion of technology. The "hands-on imperitive." Upholding the right to fork
* Openness - Placing a high value on freedom of inquiry; hostility to secrecy , information needs to be free for hackers to fix, improve, and reinvent systems. A free exchange of information allows for greater overall creativity.
* Decentralization - The best way to promote the free exchange of information is to have an open system that presents no boundaries between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of equipment that he needs in his quest for knowledge, improvement, and time on-line. Hackers believe that bureaucracies, whether corporate, government, or university, are inharently flawed systems.
* Coding to improve the world

Culture
* Meritocracy - Hackers should be judged by their contribution to the community. 
* Ellegance - Hackers deeply appreciate innovative techniques which allow programs to perform complicated tasks with few instructions. A program's code was considered to hold a beauty of its own, having been carefully composed and artfully arranged
* Playful cleverness - taking the serious humorously and their humor seriously

1. World is full of problems waiting to be solved - Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes lots of effort. The effort takes motivation. Successful athletes get their motivation from a kind of physical delight in making their bodies perform, in pushing themselves past their own physical limits. Similarly, to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice - Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating new problems waiting out there.
