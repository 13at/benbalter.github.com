Working in DC, "hacker" can often be seen as a four-letter word. I can't count the number of timess a press aide or government attorney has cringed at seeing it in a press release, or even worse, as an event audaciously entitled a "hackaton". To the media and many government types the word hacker often conjures up images of malcontents in the dark of night basked in the glow of a computer screen and wearing menacing ski masks, but to the rest of the world, the term has a very, very different connotation. Merriam-Webster defines hacker as:

  1. "One that hacks" ("to write computer programs for enjoyment"), 
  2. "a person who is inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity", and
  3. "an expert at programming and solving problems with a computer"

Being a hacker isn't about stealing credit card numbers or disabling public utilities, but rather the exact oposite. It's about sharing, openness, decentralization… *coding to improve world*. It's about trying to satisfy an unquenchable thirst for defying expectations and making the impossible a reality.

The term traces its routes back to MIT in the 1960s when it emerged to describe a certain playful cleverness of exploration that surrounded those who openly pushed the limits of the world's first computers. Today it continues to embody that ethic as the persuit of excelence — constantly asking oneself "is this even possible?" It's the intrinsic delight one gets from solving never-solved problems and overcomming limits presumed to be impossible.

## The Hacker Ethic

Answering this call has been described in many ways, most notably by Steven Levy as the Hacker Ethic:

* **Sharing** - Access gives hackers the opportunity to take things apart, fix, or improve upon them and to learn and understand how they work. This gives them the knowledge to create new and even more interesting things and ultimately aids the expansion of technology. The "hands-on imperitive." Upholding the right to fork
* **Openness** - Placing a high value on freedom of inquiry; hostility to secrecy , information needs to be free for hackers to fix, improve, and reinvent systems. A free exchange of information allows for greater overall creativity.
* **Decentralization** - The best way to promote the free exchange of information is to have an open system that presents no boundaries between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of equipment that he needs in his quest for knowledge, improvement, and time on-line. Hackers believe that bureaucracies, whether corporate, government, or university, are inharently flawed systems. And above all,
* **Coding to improve the world**

## The Hacker Way

But it's more than that. There's a practical side. There's a constant intelectual itch just begging to be scratched. Eric S. Raymond, famous for authoring the Cathedral and the Bazar [put it well:](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html):

* **The world is full of problems waiting to be solved**. Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes lots of effort. The effort takes motivation. Successful athletes get their motivation from a kind of physical delight in making their bodies perform, in pushing themselves past their own physical limits. Similarly, to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.
* **No problem should ever have to be solved twice** - Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating new problems waiting out there.

## Hacker Culture

* **Meritocracy** - Hackers should be judged by their contribution to the community. 
* **Ellegance** - Hackers deeply appreciate innovative techniques which allow programs to perform complicated tasks with few instructions. A program's code was considered to hold a beauty of its own, having been carefully composed and artfully arranged
* **Playful cleverness** - taking the serious humorously and their humor seriously
