title: The difference between 18F and USDS
excerpt: ""
---

You may have notice two parallel efforts at modernizing the way government approaches technology taking foothold in the Beltway over the past several months: 18F and the US Digital Service (USDS). Although similar on paper, the two approach the challenge with divergent goals. One was created to ship culture, the other was created to ship confidence.

It all began about three years ago with the introduction of the **[Presidential Innovation Fellows** (PIF) program](presidentialinnovation.org). Modeled after [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) and the [Presidential Management Fellows program](http://pmf.gov), the PIF program was designed to parachute skilled, private sector technologists into government for six month stints at a particular agency, technologists that would not otherwise consider a career in government.[disclosure]

### 18F

The program was a success, and soon a group called **[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov)** was stood up within the General Services Administration to continue their efforts, to centralize forward-thinking technologists in government under one administrative umbrella, and to provide a vehicle for changed that wasn't tied so closely to the administration and the highly political space in which it operates on a daily basis. 18F attracts the same type of West-coast talent the PIF program was designed to attract and embodies a similar open-source-first mentality as the PIF program, but most members of 18F are in it for the long-haul, and are not hired for time-limited terms.

There's also a bit of nuance in how 18F maintains engagements with "client" agencies (as a private sector firm might), rather than embedding technologists in the agency itself, but the play's essentially the same as the PIF program, and in fact, 18F actually houses the PIFs today, both physically and bureaucratically.[eol] 18F is [insanely dogmatic about working in the open](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy), and will refuse to work with an agency unless they adopt 18Fs culture and workflow for the project. For 18F, the goal isn't simply to deliver the piece of software they set out to create, but to leave the partner agency with a better sense of what modern software development looks like outside the Beltway.

For them a win might be their name on the front page of the Washington Post, but an even better win would be the agency's name in the headline, taking credit for, and continuing 18Fs work. It's the teach a man how to fish strategy, a culture's a first-class deliverable right along side the open-source code that it creates. Think of them like the consultant in the movie Hitch. They're the guy behind the scenes whispering a few pointers to help you be the best you you can be.

### The `healthcare.gov` wakeup call

 While 18F was finding its footing, `healthcare.gov` happened. [The administration realized simply throwing more money at "enterprise grade solutions" wasn't a defensible strategy](http://ben.balter.com/2014/12/18/geeks-and-suits/#the-age-of-the-geek), at least not in the long run. The government needed to get smart about technology, and needed to get smart fast. The dirty secret of government IT is that most agencies don't employ developers or folks that read Hacker News over their lunch break in order to stay abreast of industry trends, and if they do, they're certainly not invited to the types of meetings that decide things like `healthcare.gov`. Instead, most government agencies employ what we'd call program managers in the private sector, and contract out to a small cadre of firms for the heavy lifting.

  Imagine you're one of the President's senior advisers and you're getting asked questions about `healthcare.gov`. You're immediate concern is putting out the fire, getting the website back up, and if we're honest, being able to report to the press that you've righted the wrong to get the story out of the news. Once the crises subsides, you'll be asked a second round of questions: *How'd this happen? What's going to be the next `healthcare.gov` and how can we prevent it?*.



 [disclosure]: Full disclosure, I was [a member of the inaugural round of fellows](http://ben.balter.com/2013/09/30/ten-things-you-learn-as-a-presidential-innovation-fellow/).

 [eol]: As a result, I'd be surprised if the PIF program survived the next administration in its current form, but that's neither here nor there.
