title: The difference between 18F and USDS
excerpt: ""
---

You may have noticed two parallel efforts at modernizing the way government approaches technology taking foothold in the Beltway over the past several months: 18F and the US Digital Service (USDS). Although similar on paper, the two approach the challenge with two very divergent goals: one was created to ship culture and the other was created to ship confidence. It's the age-old saga of [geeks versus suits](http://ben.balter.com/2014/12/18/geeks-and-suits/).

### A long time in the making

The story of 18F and USDS (and their divergence) begins about three years ago with the introduction of the **[Presidential Innovation Fellows** (PIF) program](http://presidentialinnovation.org). Modeled after [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) and the [Presidential Management Fellows program](http://pmf.gov), the PIF program was designed to parachute skilled, private sector technologists into government for six month stints at a particular agency, technologists that wouldn't otherwise consider a career in government. The goal was simple: bust the beltway bubble and expose government to private-sector thinking.[disclosure]

The PIF program was a success, and soon a group called **[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov)** was created within the General Services Administration (GSA) not only to house the PIFs, both physically and bureaucratically[eol], but also to continue and augment their efforts — to centralize forward-thinking technologists in government under one administrative umbrella, and to provide a vehicle for changed that wasn't tied so closely to the administration and the highly political space in which it operates on a daily basis. In practice, 18F attracts the same type of outside-the-Beltway talent that the PIF program was designed to attract, and embodies a similar open-source-first mentality, but unlike the PIF program were many members simply took sabbaticals from their private-sector jobs, members of 18F traditionally jump ship and are in it for the long-haul with less time-limited terms.[hiring-authority]

### 18F — Here's the best way to build software (and you can too!)

18F is an odd duck, at least when compared to how bureaucratic entities normally interact with one another. There's a bit of nuance in how 18F maintains engagements with "partner" agencies (just as a private sector firm might have "clients"), rather than embedding technologists in the agency itself (like the PIF program did), but the play's essentially the same:

18F's secret sauce is that it is [insanely dogmatic about collaborating in the open](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy), and after expending a great deal of organizational energy painting a picture of a citizen-centric future and doing their best to inspire agency stakeholders that the way 18F approaches technology is vastly superior to the status quo (spolier: it is), they will simply refuse to work with an agency unless the agency agrees to adopt 18Fs culture and workflow, at least for the project at hand.

For 18F, the goal isn't simply to deliver the piece of software that they were asked to create, but to leave the partner agency with a better sense of and appreciation for what modern software development looks like outside the Beltway. For them a win might be their name on the front page of the Washington Post talking about a new service that launched, but an even better win would be the agency's name to be the one in the headline, taking credit for, and continuing 18Fs work once the engagement concluded.

Sure, it's leading by example, but it's also the teach-a-cio-how-to-fish strategy, and culture's a first-class deliverable right along side the open-source code that the culture creates. Think of them like the consultant in the movie Hitch: they're the guy behind the scenes whispering a few pointers in your ear to help you be the best you you can be (except without all the food poisoning and drama).

### The `healthcare.gov` wakeup call

Let's rewind a bit. On October 1st, 2013 `healthcare.gov` happened. While surely it wasn't the impetus for modern IT reform efforts, it certainly made them a priority among the non-technical. [The administration quickly realized that simply throwing more money at "enterprise grade solutions" wasn't a defensible strategy](http://ben.balter.com/2014/12/18/geeks-and-suits/#the-age-of-the-geek), at least not in the long run. The West Wing knew that the government needed to get smart about technology, and needed to get smart fast, not to mention, coming off the tech-centric 2008 and 2012 campaign cycles, there was a legacy as "the technology president" at stake.

Although `healthcare.gov` was the first time that a recent policy initiative risked failure due to our inability to execute from a technical perspective, it was far from the first time change agents in government pushed for the need to modernize federal IT. You see, the dirty secret of government IT is that most agencies don't employ developers or the types of folks that read Hacker News over their lunch break to stay abreast of industry trends, and if they do, they're certainly not invited to the types of meetings that decide things like how to launch `healthcare.gov`. Instead, many IT executives are life-long bureaucrats, promoted from within the government ranks, with agencies primarily employing what we'd call program managers in the private sector, contracting out the overwhelming balance of development and subject-matter expertise (read: technical know-how) to a small cadre of government contracting firms.

Imagine that its October 2013 and you're one of the President's senior advisers. You're getting asked questions about `healthcare.gov`, which is currently the lead story on just about every news channel globally. You're immediate concern is putting out the fire, getting the website back up, and if we're honest, being able to report to the press that you've righted the wrong. You want to get the story out of the news. But once the crises subsides, you'll start to be asked a second round of equal disconcerting questions: *How'd this happen? What's going to be the next `healthcare.gov` and how can we prevent it?*.

### USDS — We're on it boss (okay, listen, here's what you're going to do)

That's where USDS comes in. USDS exists to prevent the next `healthcare.gov`. Full stop.

[disclosure]: Full disclosure, I was [a member of the inaugural round of fellows](http://ben.balter.com/2013/09/30/ten-things-you-learn-as-a-presidential-innovation-fellow/).

[eol]: As a result, I'd be surprised if the PIF program survived the next administration in its current form, but that's neither here nor there.

[hiring-authority]: Technically speaking, most members of 18F are full time government employees (FTEs) hired under "direct hire" hiring authority for non-competed positions. That means that they are term-limited to two years, with an option to renew for two more, but when you're attracting 20- or 30-somethings, 2-4 years is a non-negligible percent of a technologist's life, and very possibly a plurality of their professional career.
