title: Geeks and suits
excerpt: ""
---

There are two types of people in the open government/data/source community: geeks and suits.

**Geeks** are the doers, the creators, the ones often relegated to the basement, desk stereotypically scattered with Doritos crumbs and Mountain Dew cans. To them, the status quo is nails on a chalk board. They may be coders, designers, or UX experts, but at their core, they're hackers. They're excited about the next big thing, and have the means to make it happen, at least technically.

The **Suits** are the sayers, the thought leaders, the ones in the corner office, desk stereotypically scattered with business cards and TPS reports. To them, the future is an opportunity. They may be CIOs, managers, or ____, but at their core, they're not technical. They're excited about the next big thing, and may have the means to make it happen, at least in terms of capital, politically or financially.

The odd thing is that geeks and suits never talk.

### A geek in suit's clothing

At GitHub, we're lucky to have a product that many developers lovingly use on the weekend, and would love to use at work, if they were given the opportunity. A big part of what I do at GitHub is simply putting on a suit and talking suit to the other suits, telling them exactly what their developers would tell them, if they were given the chance: open source is not the next big thing, it's already here.

Often after explaining version control, APIs, and other modern web-development practices I'm asked if there are profesional services consultants that can answer questions and walk them through the technical details. They almost don't believe me when I suggest that not only do these people exist, but that they're already on the payroll.

### Two very different communities

Most technology conferences, both in terms of marketing and in terms of programming, optimize for exactly one of these two groups. 

### The age of the geek
