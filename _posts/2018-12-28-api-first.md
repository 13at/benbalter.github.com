title: API First

"API-first" architectures have been among the tech-circle buzz for a number of years now. The idea being that you should build the connections for machines to access the underlying logic before building the human-facing interface, rather than the other way around, as is often the case.

While API-first may make sense from an engineering standpoint, in terms of interoperability, resilience, and data portability, it also makes sense from a product standpoint.

When we talk about features, we often talk about deliverables, or at least their most obvious form, which may be reduced to "a button to do X" or "a dropdown to choose Y". While you may be eager to get such functionality into the hands of users and to realize the deliverable, for many features, it may make sense to expose the underlying logic to your most critical users first.

* **APIs reduce risk**. User experience is hard. Rather than field testing the underlying logic and the user interface simultaneously (or allowing one to be blocked on the other), exposing APIs allows you to ship a subset of the overall feature early on, and coarse correct, as necessary.
* **APIs allow you to validate assumptions**. They allow you to get functionality into users' hands and see how they use it,
* **APIs serve as *de facto* product specs**. They requiring you to enumerate data models and work through edge cases.
* **API consumers are extremely critical**. Should the result have been returned as `1` instead of `'1'` or `null` instead of `""`? Is the logic case sensitive? Does unexpected input cause things to break? You can spend a good deal of time 


* Nobody notices
* Extremely critical
