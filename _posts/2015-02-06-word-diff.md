title: "Diff (and collaborate on) Microsoft Word documents using GitHub"
excerpt: "Word Diff empowers you to be a Markdown person in a Microsoft Word world by automatically converting Word documents to Markdown each time you commit to GitHub, where they can be diffed, tracked, and collaborated on."

Being both a lawyer and a developer, it can be frusting to see the best collaboration tools of our generation — version control — being left on the wayside by professionals that collaborate on documents each day, in favor of the lowest common collaborative denominator: emailing Microsoft Word documents with ambiguously versioned file names.

At GitHub we use Git and the pull request flow to collaborate on everything, not just software, but working with government agencies and outside counsel, we're often forced to fall back to "the old way" of doing things. You'd be hard pressed to find a better way to troll a developer than to swap out distributed version control for in-document tracked changes.

*What did you change in the last round of redlines? How do I know you didn't just turn off track changes and make me promise to sell you my soul? How can my coworkers propose a change? What metadata am I inadvertently sending to you in this black box? Why is there all this formatting noise for such as simple change? And most importantly, what happens when the file inevitably becomes corrupt?*

Geeks solved this problem decades ago. It's called version control. We know that if so much as a single character is off, entire programs come crashing to a halt. That's why we have evolved collaboration tools like GitHub, to track every changed, both proposed or realized, from both internal and external collaborators, but, [the business world hasn't followed the same route](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/19/we-ve-been-trained-to-make-paper/). That's where [Word Diff](https://github.com/benbalter/word_diff) comes in. *It empowers you to be a Markdown person in a Microsoft Word world.*

Let say you're working on a Word Document, and have made three rounds of changes, committing the file to a Git repository each time. Your change history might look something like this:

![Changes to a .docx file](/wp-content/uploads/2015/docx-diff.png){: style="width: 100%" }

As you work, Word Diff sits on a server (in my case Heroku), waiting for you to push your changes. When you do, it springs into action, automatically converting the document to Markdown after each commit:

![Changes to a .md file](/wp-conent/uploads/2015/md-diff.png){: style="width: 100%" }

You'll notice that for each change I made to `important-file.docx`, Word Diff made that same change to `important-file.md`, crediting me as the author, and preserving my original commit message. That way Git functions like blame and history work as you'd expect.

If you were to click the first commit, you'd see exactly what was changed, without the need to download a large, proprietary file; leave the comfort of your browser; or fire up slow desktop software:

![Formatting Diff](/wp-content/uploads/2015/formatting-diff.png){: style="width: 100%" }

But last February, GitHub introduced [rendered prose diffs](https://github.com/blog/1784-rendered-prose-diffs) to better visualize changes to human-readable text. If we click on the second commit, you can see exactly what content was changed:

![Content Diff](/wp-content/uploads/2015/content-diff.png){: style="width: 100%" }

Heck, you could even do a split diff if you really wanted to dig into things:

![Split diff](/wp-content/uploads/2015/split-diff.png){: style="width: 100%" }

At each iteration, I simply committed the Word document (either via command line, or via the visual interface of GitHub for Mac/Windows), and WordDiff silently took care of the rest.

When would you use this? Lets say you're collaborating on text with someone. Normally, you'd probably email Word documents with tracked changes back and forth. With Word Diff you can use Git's native cryptographic diff functionality to quickly verified what's changed in a given iteration, or compare different over time with a single click. More importantly, however, you can collaborate using tools like Markdown/GitHub and the person you're collaborating with will be none the wiser (using something like Pandoc or LibreOffice to convert things back to Word, if you must).

It's still a bit rough around the edges, but if you're interested in giving it a try, you can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/benbalter/word_diff) to set up your own isntance of Word Diff, or can take a peek under the hood by looking a the [Word to Markdown Ruby Gem](https://github.com/benbalter/word-to-markdown). I'd love your feedback (and help making it better).
