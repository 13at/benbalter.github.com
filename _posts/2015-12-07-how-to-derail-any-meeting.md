title: how to derail any meeting
description:
---

A few weeks ago, the Office of Strategic Services "[Simple Sabotage Field Manual](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184)" made its way around the internets. The book, published in 1944 by the predecessor to the CIA had such headings as "*Encouraging Destructiveness*", but it was the section on "*General Interference with Organizations and Production*" that caught my eye, not because I intent to sabotage any organizations in the near future, but because I see so many modern knowledge workers unintentionally doing to their own organization exactly what the OSS described some 70 years ago. Here are a few of my favorite[^disclaimer] from the list:

> * **Insist on doing everything through "channels."** Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.
> * **Haggle over precise wordings** of communications, minutes, resolutions.
> * **Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting** and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.
> * **Advocate "caution."** Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.
> * **Be worried about the propriety of any decision** — raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.
> * When possible, **refer all matters to committees**, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the committees as large as possible — never less than five.
> * Make "speeches." **Talk as frequently as possible and at great length.** Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.
> * **Bring up irrelevant issues** as frequently as possible.
> * In making work assignments, **always sign out the unimportant jobs first**.
> * **Insist on perfect work** in relatively unimportant products.

Any of those tactics sound familiar? Any of those that you haven't experienced in a meeting at least once? This week? While I doubt your coworkers are actually double agents for the now-defunct OSS, there's something to be said for the fact that the behaviors that were once used as means of espionage, are now all-too-common corporate anti-patterns.

That got me thinking: what additional anti-patterns would the OSS add if they were writing that field manual for modern times? The common thread here, is to **maximize meta-discussion** — the discussion about having the discussion you need to have before you can do the work you actually                      set out to do:

* What are we solving for? 
* What's the goal of this meeting? 
* Can we define the scope of the project?
* If there is more than one goal, insist that you decide on one before proceeding
* What does success look like?
* What's our success metric?
* How do we measure our success metric?
* I really think X stakeholder should be here before we make a decision
* If there are other similar efforts, insist the effort at hand be distinguished before proceeding
* Show up when it's expected to start, or even better, assume it'll start a few minutes late
* Don't take into account AV needs until after the start time
* Don't do any work outside the meeting. Meetings are when your team does work.
* Insist on introductions, especially as latecomers enter the meeting
* Show up late and revist already-decided issues 
* Restate issues addressed in prepatory materials (which you didn't read)
