title: how to derail any meeting

A few weeks ago, the Office of Strategic Services "[Simple Sabotage Field Manual](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184)" made its way around the internets. The book, published in 1944 by the predecessor to the CIA had such headings as "Encouraging Destructiveness", but it was the section on "General Interference with Organizations and Production" that caught my eye, not because I intent to sabotage any organizations in the near future, but because I see so many unintentionally doing to their own organization exactly what the OSS described some 70 years ago. Here are a few of my favorite[^disclaimer] from the list:

> * **Insist on doing everything through "channels."** Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.
> * **Haggle over precise wordings** of communications, minutes, resolutions.
> * **Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting** and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.
> * **Advocate "caution."** Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.
> * **Be worried about the propriety of any decision** — raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.
> * When possible, **refer all matters to committees**, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the committees as large as possible — never less than five.
> * Make "speeches." **Talk as frequently as possible and at great length.** Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.
> * **Bring up irrelevant issues** as frequently as possible.
> * In making work assignments, **always sign out the unimportant jobs first**.
> * **Insist on perfect work** in relatively unimportant products.

Any of those tactics sound familiar? Any of those that you haven't experienced in a meeting at least once? While I doubt your coworkers are actually double agents for the now-defunct OSS, there's something to be said for the fact that the behaviors that were once used as means of espionage, are now common corporate anti-patterns.

That got me thinking: what additional anti-patterns would the OSS add if they were writing that field manual today?
