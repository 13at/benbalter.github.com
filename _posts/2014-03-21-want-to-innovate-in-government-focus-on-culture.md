When innovating in government, [the technology's the easy part](http://ben.balter.com/2013/07/01/technologys-the-easy-part/). Innovative efforts in government do two things: they take long-established [technology from the private sector](http://ben.balter.com/2013/09/30/ten-things-you-learn-as-a-presidential-innovation-fellow/#innovative-efforts-in-government-are-standard-practice-in-the-startup-world) and inject it into an agency, or they reimagine long-assumed processes [from the citizen's perspective](https://twitter.com/BenBalter/status/444941012016713728).

### The ultimate yak shave

If you want to innovate government, 90 day, 120 day, or six month "fellowships" (read: glorified internships) aren't the way to do it. Talk to any Code For America or Presidential Innovation Fellow and you'll hear a reoccurring theme: absent sufficient cultural, administrative, and political support, between 30 and 60 percent of your time will be spent not doing what you were brought on to do, but rather convincing others that you should be doing it (and that they should help).

You have to fight for the tools, you have to fight for the workflows, you have to fight for the resources, and you have to fight for the solution itself. Every step is a fight, and that's assuming you don't have to argue things that are assumed in the rest of the world like the security of PHP and Ruby or the need for continuos deployment. And we've only just touched the surface of the technological considerations. There are countless layers of policy, administrative, and bureaucratic hoops to jump through or otherwise route around.

### Bureaucracy is an organism

Bureaucracy's primary goal is survival. Like any organism, it has an immune system. The red blood cells of bureaucracy are general counsels, privacy officers, security officers, and paperwork reducers, among other bureaucrats. It's in their personal and organizational interest to reduce risk to as close to zero as possible. They thrive in a culture of "no".

An innovator's primary goal is the exact opposite. It's sustainable disruption. These two countervailing interests — administrative and business — balance each other out in most organizations, however, absent the traditional profit motive, government gives the immune system the privileged position of veto authority over just about every agency decision.

### Never take "no" from someone who can't say "yes"

You could have the most innovative idea, perfectly executed, and fully within the letter of the law, but if any one of the ten to fifteen layers of agency's immune system so much as sniffs an antibody they don't like, the effort's dead in the water. It's bureaucratic allergies.

So how do you solve for the naysayer majority? What's the Claritin or Zyrtec of bureacuracy? culture. Culture isn't getting a coworker a card for her birthday, or an office-wide March Madness tournament. Culture is the set of unspoken assumptions that start any conversation. Culture defines the realm of the possible.

What if when you first approached your general counsel for "approval" of your innovative new idea, you didn't have to explain open source software, APIs, or distributed version control, but could say "hey, we're launching a Rails app with a read-only API. The code's going to be on GitHub", and they simply said "okay". What if those you relied on understood not necessarily the how, but at least the why?

### What if your biggest fight was outside, not inside your organization?

"Parashooing" change agents into an organization is great, but if you really want to inject innovation in government, look at the support roles. Non-technical stakeholders have become the "blockers" in the true software sense of the word, and today, it is they, not the underlying technology that is in need of innovation.

What if every Wednesday the General Services Administration invited an innovator — a CEO or CIO of a prominent private sector company — to come inspire government employees, both technical and otherwise, to hear how their company works on a day-to-day basis. We're not talking about a sales pitch, we're talking a super informal, Inside the Actor's Studio style "ask me anything". How do you handle hiring? Customer service? How do you decide which ideas to run with? What's in your stack? How often do you deploy?

The idea is to pop the beltway bubble — expose otherwise isolated career government employees, not to cutting-edge ideas, but to commonplace practices well established in the private sector, to redefine the norm, to fold the map in half and bring a bit of the West coast to the East coast.

If you want to foster innovation, when an innovator approaches a non-technical stakeholder, there needs to be a common appreciation for one another's craft, and more importantly, a common vocabulary. I'm not talking typical government alphabet soup, but the type of vocabular that you expect between skinny-jeaned coworkers at a stereotypical San Francisco startup. Heck, even GitHub's accountant [learned how to code in her spare time](#).

August 2012

* Google-style lectures - Bring in the smartest of the smartest (google, twitter, foursquare, whatever), put them in an auditorium, and have them talk to Government IT folks about what's next in terms of tech. how to, etc.
* Conferences - Establish a fund to get Gov. IT folks to private sector (read: outside of DC) conferences on Tech.
* Open source crash course  - 1  /2 day gov-only hackathon for non-technical folks to learn what's out there. How it's easy to build an API on top of a dataset using Rails, etc. Aka, become informed consumers
