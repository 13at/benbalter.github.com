Sure, maybe the code hasn&#8217;t been written yet, but you know that once it is, it will ultimately do that thing you want it to do â€” the technology&#8217;s the easy part.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the culture we&#8217;ve go to worry about. Will the solution be adopted by the agency? Will existing habits subvert the cool thing you just made? Will it live on once you&#8217;ve moved on to the next project? If you ignore culture, even the most elegant technological solutions can end up condemned to a dusty shelf as nothing more than the right solution to the wrong problem.</p>\n\n<h2 id='this_is_why_we_cant_have_nice_things'>This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things</h2>\n\n<p>Great technologies already exist. Lots of them in fact. Yet public servants still insist on adopting and subsequently entrenching their inferior predecessors. There&#8217;s a reason that heavyweight, proprietary systems are a sad running joke in the Beltway.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> The problem isn&#8217;t developing newer, better, flashier tools or tools that are more open or more intellectually elegant. The problem is creating the culture and the ecosystem necessary to begin appreciating and sustaining the ones we&#8217;ve already got. The ones we&#8217;re already not using.</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;re geeks. We&#8217;re good at building things. Heck, it&#8217;s fun, and it&#8217;s what we do best. But it&#8217;s time to realize that we&#8217;re merely playing whack-a-mole. We keep building increasingly larger mallets thinking that if it were just <em>that much easier</em> to knock the mole back down, maybe it will finally stay there. Spoiler alert: it wont.</p>\n\n<h2 id='dat_elegant_solution'>Dat Elegant solution</h2>\n\n<p>There was a <a href='https://twitter.com/dan_munz/status/351065902642503681'>recent exchange on the Twitters</a> with some members of the open government community whom I respect greatly about <a href='https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/readme.md'>a recent proposal</a>, but I&#8217;m afraid they miss the point. The need for a distributed version control system to handle real time and large-scale government data would be a great problem to have. It&#8217;d be great because it&#8217;d mean that the demand was there. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not, at least not yet.</p>\n\n<p>I watch day in and day out as many of my former colleagues fight tooth-and-nail trying to convince well-meaning government bureaucrats to toss a scrap of government data over the firewall. It&#8217;s a tiring process. After all, whack-a-mole is, by definition, a loosing game. Lets overcome our temptation to build bigger, sexier tools, and instead focus on lowering the barrier to entry. To make it easier to do the right thing. Let&#8217;s build really, really boring stuff. The more boring the better. In many cases, let&#8217;s not build anything.</p>\n\n<h2 id='the_culture_is_criminal'>The culture is criminal</h2>\n\n<p>The problem isn&#8217;t that government agencies want to share vast swaths of data, or that they want to share it with increasing frequency, or to the point, that they lack the tools to do so. It&#8217;s the exact opposite. It&#8217;s that sharing data is seen as being too onerous. It&#8217;s too taxing. It diverts funding from mission. It&#8217;s a political liability. It&#8217;s not ingrained in the culture. And frankly, <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2013/05/14/we-ve-been-selling-open-source-wrong/'>we&#8217;re not helping</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We should make it so ridiculously straightforward for government agencies to distribute information and build collaborative communities around shared problems that it would be criminal for them not to. To break the bad habits. To get rid of the excuses. To educate. To inform. To inspire.</p>\n\n<p>Complex, bleeding edge tools aren&#8217;t the solution to making government more open. Even our <a href='http://healtcare.gov'>flagship efforts</a> expose that well-established tools still baffle those the government turns to to implement them.<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup></p>\n<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> SharePoint, Cold Fusion, PDFs, Oracle databases, Blackberrys, and just about &#8220;enterprise&#8221; anything.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li><li id='fn:2'>\n<p><em>E.g.,</em> <a href='https://github.com/CMSgov/HealthCare.gov-Open-Source-Release#ruby-on-rails'>not knowing the difference between Ruby and Rails</a>.</p>\n<a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li></ol></div>","path":"_posts/2013-06-31-technologys-the-easy-part.md"}
