This store sells only one product. Regardless of what you come in for, regardless of what question you ask, their recommendation is always the same: you should buy the only product they sell.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, this is all-to-often the face of professional services in the technology industry. We have &#8220;Drupal shops&#8221; and &#8220;WordPress shops&#8221; and &#8220;Rails shops&#8221;, but no &#8220;problem solving shops&#8221;. Yet, we know that people come to technology consultants with problems, not solutions. Imagine, for example, if Deloitte, or any other of the big four consulting firms for that matter, was a &#8220;firing shop&#8221;. That every time you came to them with a problem, they would always suggest that you fire people. Or maybe they&#8217;re a &#8220;business analytics shop&#8221;. Doesn&#8217;t matter. Regardless of what problem you bring them, the solution&#8217;s always the same: &#8220;Do [the only thing we know].&#8221; Hard to imagine they&#8217;d stay in business long, huh?</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>But that&#8217;s exactly what we do in technology. Traditional software engineers define themselves as a &#8220;PHP Developer&#8221; or a &#8220;Rails Developer&#8221; or a &#8220;Java Developer&#8221;. The solution defines who they are. The past defines the future. That&#8217;d be like an architect that only builds round buildings or a handyman that shows up for a job with only a hammer in his toolbox. No matter what you ask for, <a href='http://xkcd.com/801/'>the answer&#8217;s always going to be the same</a>. &#8220;[That thing I did yesterday].&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But technology problems come in many yet unseen shapes and sizes, and often times the best solution isn&#8217;t the same one you used on the last problem, or better yet, hasn&#8217;t even been invented yet. <a href='http://ben.balter.com/2013/02/16/what-is-a-hacker/'>Hackers</a>, on the other hand, at least from my experience, often define themselves as a &#8220;developer&#8221; who <em>has used</em> a given language. There&#8217;s already the possibility there of learning another if the job calls for it. It&#8217;s a sense of solving the problems at all costs. It&#8217;s a sense of avoiding self vendor lock-in. It&#8217;s a passion for technology, not <em>a technology</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When a potential customer comes to a technology shop, they&#8217;re not shopping for mere muscle. They&#8217;re not hiring unskilled labor. They&#8217;re shopping for experts. They&#8217;re shopping for people with a better knowledge of the space than they have. They&#8217;re shopping for a solution. Sure, a firm can specialize in something, or be known for a given skill. Nordstrom is known for its service. Apple&#8217;s known for its design, but Nordstom doesn&#8217;t just sell blue shirts, Apple doesn&#8217;t just sell desktop computers, and neither should you.</p>","path":"_posts/2013-02-27-the-store-that-sells-only-one-thing.md"}
